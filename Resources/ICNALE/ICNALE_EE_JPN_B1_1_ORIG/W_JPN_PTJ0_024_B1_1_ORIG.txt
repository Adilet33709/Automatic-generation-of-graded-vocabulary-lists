I agree with the statement because part-time job gave me lots of experiences. For example, I understood following things through part-time jobs. It is hard to make money because I have to go to part-time job when I promised day and time, even if I don't want it. I have to keep time because if I delayed, I interrupted colleague's jobs and make bad relationships. I can't stay I'm center of the world because guests choice restaurant which they want to go, so I need to make them comfortable for they choose my shop. I learned from part-time jobs how important money and to make money, to make relationship. But I learned it is makes me tired to have job at the same time. I need time to have a rest for recovery. So it is interrupt my study to have too much jobs. I agree with having a part-time job but it is better to work during long vacation like summer or spring. Because student first priority is study and part-time job should not interrupt their study.
