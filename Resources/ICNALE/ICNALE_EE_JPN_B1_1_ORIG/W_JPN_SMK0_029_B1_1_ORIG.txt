I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are some reasons. Cigarettes lead a lot of bad effects on both smokers and non-smokers. First, restaurants are places that everyone enjoys eating something and talking with his or her friends. Everyone should be happy in restaurants. Smokers may be happy to smoke. But non-smokers must be not happy, because even if non-smokers don't smoke, they have to breathe smokes of cigarettes. Even there is only a smoking person, the smoke spreads all over the room in restaurants. In my case, I don't like smoke and smell of cigarettes, so if someone smokes in restaurants, I don't want to eat there. Second, smoking during eating is not a good manner. At least during eating, smokers should smoking. Non-stopping smoking is not only a bad manner, but also can become a killer. This means that cigarettes may lead diseases to both smokers and non-smokers. Especially, the disease is cancer. Cancer is one of the difficult diseases, because it often repeats. And if the cancer is too bad, the person may die. As you know from these examples, cigarettes give only bad effects to people. That is why I think that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.
