I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have two reasons to support this opinion. The first reason is for health. Under the status quo, in some restaurants, seats are divided for smoking area and non-smoking area. But even if we sit in non-smoking area, we have to breathe smoke because it flows. The smoke raises our risk of getting cancer. It means that it harms not only smokers, also surrounding people. Tobacco is very bad for our health. When smoking is banned, we don't have to be afraid of breathing smoke and care about it in the restaurant. Without health, we can't do enough what we want to do. Health is very important for our life. Smoker must not hurt non-smokers' health. The second reason is for us to enjoy food. Imagine, when you taste delicious food, it comes to smell tobacco. Then, how do you feel? Of course you pay for the food and you want to taste as much as possible. But you can't. So smoke makes you irritating and you never come to the restaurant again. What's more, the delicious food was cooked hard by restaurant staffs for you. It's very bad situation both for restaurants and customers. Like this, now, we can't taste food enough because of smoke. If it's banned at all the restaurants, we can always just enjoy having food. We will appreciate for the food and restaurants. It's very good relationship between restaurants and customers. I think restaurant should be the place we mainly enjoy eating. Not to be interrupt tasting, smokers have to smoke outside. So in conclusion, I think smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. It's for smokers, surrounding people and restaurant staffs.
