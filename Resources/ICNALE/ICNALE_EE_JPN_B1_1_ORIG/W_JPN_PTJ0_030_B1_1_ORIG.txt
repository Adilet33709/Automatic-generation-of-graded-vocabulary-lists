I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are two reasons. First, college students can learn a lot of things which they don't study at collage through working. For example, relationship, skill and manner. I have a part-time job in Japanese restaurant. The work is very hard, and I often receive advises by colleague and the chief. Sometimes I am scolded so badly. I want to quit the work when the chief scold me. But they help me when I'm in trouble. In fact, I really thank them because they tell me the important things for society. And I become to have responsibility for my job. I really realize that I grew up mentality through working. It is good for me. Secondly, collage students can communicate with many people who they can't speak in daily life. In Japanese restaurant where I work, there are many housewives. I sometimes feel generation gap, but talking with them is very fun. We talk about rising children and money. They speak what I don't know. It is very interesting for me. I think having a part-time job give a lot of important things for society to college students.
