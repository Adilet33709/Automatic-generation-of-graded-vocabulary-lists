Ｉdon't think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Nowadays, almost all of restaurants in Japan have two different seats. One is a seat for non-smokers, the other is a seat for smokers. When you go to a restaurant, a waiter surely ask you whether you smoke or not. So if you don't smoke or you hate the smoke from a smokers, you had better choose a seat for non smokers. However, in case that you don't smoke but your husband or your friends smoke, they may choose a seat for smokers and you may put up with smoke from their. In that case, you should not put up with. You must say that you want to take a seat for non-smokers. If smoking completely banned at all the restaurants, people who are like smoking not willing to go to a restaurant. So not completely ban smoking, every restaurants should be careful about environment of restaurants. For example, put plants that keep the air fresh, or clean the air sometimes etc. It is important for restaurant to keep the environment of restaurants clean. And it is important for people who go to a restaurant to say whether you want to smoke or not. From these reasons, I don't think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
