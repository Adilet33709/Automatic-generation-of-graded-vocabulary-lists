I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. Mainly reason is that smoking is harmful for not only smokers but also non-smokers. Tobacco smoke is two types: one is main smoke and the other is sub-smoke. The former is absorbed by smokers but the latter passively by non-smokers with regard to will. If smokers have manners, smoke floats into the air. It is stuffed unconsciously. At first, restaurants are the place that people gather and enjoy eating. The food is good with both taste and smell. If smoke float in the restaurant, it reduce the dish taste by half. Although people have the freedom to smoke, they may not harm others' feeling, let alone at table. In fact, smoking has been banned from 10:00 to 14:00 on holiday in the Doughnut shop I work for a year. The time is peak people gather. I feel that the more families with children come to shop comparing with before. It shows that more people dislike smoking. All people can enjoy meal equally at any time in any place. In Europe, most countries ban smoking in the restaurant. Following Europe, it needs to be ban in Japan too.
