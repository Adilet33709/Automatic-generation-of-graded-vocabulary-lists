I don't think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. This is because that some people who are smokers have rights to do what they want to do, as other people who are not smokers also have them. Of course, I disagree with that smokers should smoke anytime and anywhere. And I also disagree with that smokers should be smoking when they are walking or working. Some people who think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country may say that smoking is very harmful and bad for the healthes of the smoker and near people of him, and I think that they are right. In fact, I don't like smokers very much. But I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country is too strict for smokers. I also think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country is not fair for smokers. So, I think that at least, some spaces where smokers can smoke freely are made at all the restaurants in the country. This is why I don't think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
