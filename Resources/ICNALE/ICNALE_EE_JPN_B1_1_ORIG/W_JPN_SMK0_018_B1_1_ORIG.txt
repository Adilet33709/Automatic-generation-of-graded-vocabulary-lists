I agree the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Because restaurants are places where we enjoy something special foods and conversation with friends, family, or a boyfriend or girlfriend. Smoking doesn't need there. Smoking in restaurants has two bad things. One is that smell of smoking is bad for foods. For example, we can't enjoy the smell of foods if there are people who are smoking in the restaurant. Smell is an important part of food. We enjoy foods by not only taste but also smell. Smell can make foods good, or otherwise it can make foods bad. And the other is that smoke is bad for health. In restaurants, there are a lot of people, babies, children, teens, adults, and olds. Smoking has bad influence in them all. Smoking is bad for health of all people, especially bad for health of babies and pregnancy women. Smoking people don't have the right to make their health bad. Smoking has these two bad things. That's why I agree the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. People who smoke should consider foods of that restaurant and health of people around them.
