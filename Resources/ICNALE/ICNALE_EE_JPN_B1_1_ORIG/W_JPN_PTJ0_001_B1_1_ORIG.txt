I agree with the statement. I think there are two points for the reason I agree. First, to have a part-time job when we are college students can be a preparation for being a member of society. I have had a part-time job for four years. My part-time job is teaching junior high school students Math and English. I learned many important things. For example, how to talk with boss, how to deal with personal information, how to associate with my colleague. If I didn't have it, I would not have any common knowledge, sense and friend. I think I grew as a adult person compared with I was high school student. Second, it is a chance we know the importance and value of money. When I received salary which was made by myself for the first time, I thought that I mustn't waste money. Until I entered college, I used to be bought many things by my parents. It is not too much to say that I didn't know how hard we make money. Recently, many college students had a part-time job. I think they also learn many things like me. So, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
