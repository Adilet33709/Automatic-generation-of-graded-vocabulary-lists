I agree with the idea that it is important for college students to have part-time job. Of course, college students have to study. But study isn't all they have to do. They also have to experience a lot of things before they graduate the colleges and begin to work. For example, reading books, listening music, playing sports, and trip. In regard to trip, they can go where they haven't visited, see what they haven't seen and feel something special. College students are not children but also not adults. Time during college student is time to experience and feel a lot of things. And so, they prepare to become perfect adults. For that, they need some money. They have to prepare money they need by themselves, because they aren't children. Their parents mustn't give them money and they mustn't depend on help of their parents. To use money they work and get is important. Through using money they work and get, they can know importance of money and way to use money. That's why they have to have part-time job.
