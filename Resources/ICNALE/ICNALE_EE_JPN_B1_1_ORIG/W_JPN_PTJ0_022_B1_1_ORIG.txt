I think that it is important for college student to have a part-time job. This is because that they can learn a lot of things through their part-time jobs. For example, they work in a store, they learn that to smile is very important, and that there are a lot of types of people in the society. This is also because that their experiences which were got by their part-time jobs are very useful, when they look for what they want to be in the future. They can do various types of part-time jobs, so it helps for them to look for what they want to be in the future. And this is because that they cannot do a part-time job when they start to work. When they are college students, they have a lot of time to do a part-time job. But when they start to work, they don't have. And this is also because that to do a lot of part-time jobs when they were college students will become a good memory in the future. They will enjoy their lives better by the memories. For these reasons, I think that it is important for college student to have a part-time job. This is because that they can learn a lot of things through their part-time jobs.
