It is important for collage students to have part time job. I have two reasons. One is to make money. Collage students have much time comparing with members of society. Adults often say, I have money but no time. We can do what we want to do as far as time permitted. Therefore they need money. The other is to have many opportunities through part time job. Part time job enables us not only to make money but also to make friends, have a sense of responsibility, learn manner of society and so on. As far as for me, I have had a part time job and worked at Doughnut shop for 3 years. I work from 5:00 to 9:00 and go to school twice or three times a week. Since I started a part time job, I have changed. For example, I contact with wide range people from children to old people through part time job. I learned how to talk with each people. The skill helped me at interviews of job hunting. Consequently I could receive notice of informal decision. In case of me, I sometimes travel by money I earned. I have been to India, Australia, South Africa and so on. I had invaluable experiences there. I couldn't get such experiences by pocket money from parents. But there is one thing that I may not forget. The main work for students is not part time job but study. So students must do part time job as it doesn't interrupt study.
