I agree with this statement, and I think that college students should have a part-time job. I have three reasons for this. First, they can learn a lot trough having a part-time job, and it will be useful in their future. For example, I worked at a Hotel as a service stuff in banquet. Through this job I could notice that it is not easy to earn money, and I felt appreciate to my parents, because they have worked for me since I was born. If I hadn't have a part-time job, I would never get such a feeling. This is one lesson from my working experience, but I believe every college student can learn something important through doing a job. So in my opinion, college students should have a part-time job. Second, having a part-time job gives them a lot of information about the occupation. Then if they have a several kinds of jobs in their university days, they can know what kind of jobs they really want to do in the future. I mean that having a part-time job brings happy lives for college students. Third, I think students have to have a part-time job, and earn money by their selves, because college students need a lot of money for trip, study, or play with their friends. However, they should not make their parents pay all of them. They should try to independent from their parents. So, they have to work in order to earn the money that they need. In conclusion, from these three reasons, I believe that having a part-time job is important for college students.
