I agree with this opinion. There are two reasons. First, it is painful for people who don't smoke to have dinner in the restaurant. They often get worse when people are smoking. Some people say, We don't have to ban smoking in the restaurants. It is enough to make the non smoking seats. It may be better than there are not non smoking seats, but we can't say it is enough. Because smoke really can go everywhere in the restaurants, so people who don't smoke finally get smoke. The managers in restaurants should be more careful for their guests to enjoy having the dinner. Second, smoking made the restaurants dirty. I have a part-time job in Japanese restaurant and guests can smoke everywhere in the restaurant. After the guests go back home, I clean up the room. Then, I always find that there are a lot of ashes on the tatami. It is really hard to clean. And I also find the color of walls is getting yellow a little. I can't believe there are people who don't hesitate to make the room dirty. They are guests, but it is natural to be should keep the manners.
