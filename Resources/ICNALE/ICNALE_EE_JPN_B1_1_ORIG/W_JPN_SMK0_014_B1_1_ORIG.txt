I agree with this statement. In these days, many restaurants in Japan are likely to separate the smoking room from non-smoking room. However some of them fail to separate them completely. This means that even if I take the table in non-smoking area, you may smell the cigarette from the smoking room. Smoking from cigarette makes me uncomfortable, especially when I have a meal. In my opinion, the solution of this problem is that smoking will be completely banned at all the restaurants. Moreover smoking is bad for health, and some studies showed that if they smoke while they are eating, the risk of getting cancer is increased. So, Japanese government should make smoking banned at all restaurants in order to save all citizens' health. From my personal experience, I believe that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in Japan. One of my friends could quite to smoke by the number of non-smoking area being increasing. It becomes harder for her to find the area where smoking is allowed. This makes her smoking less cigarettes per a day. Then she doesn't want to smoke anymore now. Therefore since I heard this story, I've believed that policy of smoking being banned in all restaurants makes it easier to quit to smoking. That's why I believe that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in Japan.
