As one of college students, I agree to the statement, It is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have 3 reasons to support this opinion. Firstly, for students to learn how to manage money. College students don't have much money, but have lots of time. So they tend to use it too much. They're not good at control it. If they work, they'll recognize the importance and value of money. And they're going to get responsibility against money. So they will never waste it. In the near future we college students have our own family. We have to manage money all on our own. We should independent and how to control as soon as possible. Secondly, for students to know the society. Now, in university, lots of students are so lazy. Some are always late for school, some often sleep during the class and so on. Thanks to having a part-time job, they can know the responsibility against their task. There're many differences between college and society. In the society, rules are much stricter than college. If they don't know the society at all, they may not be able to be hired because of bad manner. So for students, a part-time job is one of good opportunities to practice for the future. Lastly, for companies to save money. Now in Japan, the economic situation is not good. And the companies hire less people than usual. So they're in trouble because of lack of staff. If companies hire general people, they have to pay much money. But for students, the pay is only about 800 yen per hour. Companies must want to hire students more than general people. In conclusion, I think college students should get a part-time job both for students and for companies.
