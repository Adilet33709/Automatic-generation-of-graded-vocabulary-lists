I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are some reasons. First, college students have much time than junior high school students and working people. So, college students have to use some time for working. If they have a lot of time, they often use the time for only playing. If they use it for part-time job, they may get something good for their life. This is the second reason. College students can learn a lot of things that they can't learn in only the college. They can learn, for example, the difficulty of making money, system of the society, and they can also learn the feeling that they should thank their parents. Third, I think that college students should be independent of their parents, because college students aren't children, they are almost adults. It is difficult that they are independent from their parents completely, but it is important to do that in some points. One of the points I think is having a part-time job. They should make money that they use for playing. If the money they can earn is small, the action can help their parents, I think. Those are the reasons why I think college students should have part-time job.
