I disagree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I think all Japan restaurant don't have to ban smoking. I often eat lunch or dinner with my friend who is smoker. Then we talk long time so he sometime begins smoking. If all restaurant ban smoking, I will be not able to talk and eat dinner with him. Some people may say he shouldn't smoke when he eat dinner. But it is free for him to smoke. It's his own problem whether he smoke or not. Some people dislike smoking, others not. What shall they who don't like smoke do? Almost restaurant in Japan have smoking seat. People who dislike smoke should use there. Then, they would not be interpreted by smoke. In Japan, smoking is not banned and not quilt for some people. If restaurants ban smoking, they are troubled about few customer because smokers don't enter there. So I disagree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country for smoker and restaurant..
