I agree with this opinion. There are some reasons. First, it is important for college students to learn how difficult it is to earn money. If students don't have a part-time job and they only study and enjoy their free time, they never experience the importance of earning money. Second, they can meet a lot of people through a part-time job. In their college, people who come to the college are almost same age. Probably, there are another college student, or woman who have children, or people from other region etc. Those who can know many things that you don't know or you don't learn at your college. So you can learn not only at school but also at a place you work. Third, if you experience many kind of works through a part-time job, you can learn what it is about working. And you can image how you want to work. The time that you are college students is only a few years, but you must prepare for future before graduate college. So having a part-time job is very important. I think that having a part-time job is as important as studying in college. If students spend much more time on part-time job and they can't have enough time to study, they should reduce the time that they spend on part-time job.
