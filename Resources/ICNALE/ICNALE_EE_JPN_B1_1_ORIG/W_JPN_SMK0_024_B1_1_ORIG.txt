Yes, I agree with the statement. Because I hate smoking with eat meal. Smoker has right smoking but non smoker also has right not smoking at the same time. But non smoker's right is lighter than smoker's one. Smoker's can smoke almost every where every time. Despite smoker can control their desire short time like class. If they wanted to smoke, they can go to smoking place after eating meal soon. It is hard to say not smoke to them non smoker and non smoker have no smoking place. Smoking cause of many diseases like cancer, hart diseases etc Even smoker, they don't want to have diseases. They don't want to and afraid death after getting it. But people don't stop smoking. One reason is Japanese environment. People can get cigarette easily and cheap and can smoke almost everywhere. Japanese government doesn't forbidden smoke. They don't try to reduce smoking people, announce smoking is dangerous for one's health. If smoking completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, smoker will lost one chance, one place for smoking, and some smoker may give up to smoke. It is one of the evident smoking is bad for one's health so that government banned it. And non smoker enjoy meal.
