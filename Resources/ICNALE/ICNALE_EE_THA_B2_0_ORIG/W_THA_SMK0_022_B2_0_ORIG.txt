In my opinion. I agree with completely banning smoking at all the restaurants in the country. It is very well known that smoking is toxic to health of smokers and those who are near or inhalation of cigarette smoke. Therefore, it should not look forward to smoking in restaurants that if a restaurant is not air flow or air conditioning system that smoke will be vicious in that room and harm the health of everyone. Research have come out that people who do not smoke, but they get the cigarette smoke. May be get the toxic smoke than smokers. Even in an outdoor restaurant. Although air is transferred, but smoke could still hurt the health of people around themselves. Tobacco smoke will disturbed and destroyed the atmosphere around you. I think we should be campaigning for the prohibition of smoking in public places everywhere. For good weather and good health of everyone. Surprisingly, even smokers are already aware that smoking is not healthy at all, but smoking is still the same. Probably because they thought it cool and look good but I think that smoking does not enhance the character, but it look worse. If we want to quit smoking, we would have to go back and modify our values first.
