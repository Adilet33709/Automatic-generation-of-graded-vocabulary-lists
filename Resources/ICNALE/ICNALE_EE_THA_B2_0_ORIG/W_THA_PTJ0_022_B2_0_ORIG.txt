In my opinion. I think the students will work part time to earn extra after school is not very important. If students do not have a financial problems. They should be study hard. When they have free time, they should read books or do other activity such as sport, music etc. But if a part-time job does not interfere with the time to read books or do other activity and students need to lighten the burden of home. It is better to work part-time job. We should see that their own ability. We have enough ability to learn, coupled with a part-time job without any study or not. Because at least. A part-time job is a practical experience of working with others as well. In case of students have a financial problems in the family. A part-time job is quite important because it will lighten the burden of home and earn income families to rely on themselves. So that parents do not have to worry about our expenditures. Moreover, there is also a self-trained to work experience, responsible for your work, trained themselves on time and working with others as well too. Therefore, a part-time job is important or not. It depends on several factors as well.
