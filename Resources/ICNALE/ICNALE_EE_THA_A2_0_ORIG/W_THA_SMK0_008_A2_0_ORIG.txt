I do not agree the restaurant will allow smoking in its areas because it is very dangerous and harmful for both people who are smoking and people around him, especially teenagers to take up the role and adolescents are curious and try to stop that most teenagers do not like smoking in restaurants with children and the aged, a check is made very inappropriate because it is highly toxic to other people to unconsciously. Teenagers like to smoke a lot, in canteen too especially male students like to smoke everywhere, in canteen, in front of the school, food shop or in the restaurants. They think they are cool and very handsome and girls will fall for but no it is not. A girl that like a boy who smoke is will sorry in future because she takes her life to be in danger and the risk to get cancer with that boy. She don't smoke but she smell every time so some day she may get hurt from smoking before him because no protection from smoke. If the restaurants agree to not allow people smoke, the can save many people lives because people are save from a dangerous. Should ban everywhere not only restaurants and police should got them too.
