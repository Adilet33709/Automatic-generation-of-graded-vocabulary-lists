I disagree with smoking in restaurants should be allowed because of smoking, the health damage. Danger of smoking causes diseases such as cancer, lung can make people around you smell illegally at a restaurant. I don't hate people that smoke but I don't like to smell it. I can't breath easily. I am very suffering from the smell. After they smoke and they left, many cigarette ash on the table. The next person will get ash on the dish. It's very dangerous and damage health. I am sure many people hate smoking but they don't speak out. I try to find benefit from smoking but I can't find. It may help them to relax, feel good. But I don't do that. In my opinion, it's not good idea to smoke if you have nothing to do. My friends think that it is cool and girl like it. I don't agree with that. If the restaurants allow people to smoke, it can't be restaurants. It should be night club or place to smoke. Food don't delicious and smell so bad. How can I eat that. Smoking should be in their areas, not in the restaurants. I support to ban smoking in all restaurants.
