Smoking in restaurant is should be banned. I agree with the statement. A gaffe as much as possible. Because the restaurant service Food and drink And anyone want to eat good food, atmosphere and environment. Environment conducive to eating. Smoking is one of the drugs harm the human body. Most restaurant customers will not sit smoking in their restaurants. It makes people dissatisfied customers and may not return to service any more. Restaurant is a restaurant, serving the food and drink But not to smoking customers. Some restaurants will have room for the customer sat smoking. Some restaurants will mark smoking. Because most customers will take children. An old man to sit or eat. Some families take the wife is pregnant to eat as well. And the idea of smoking itself is disturbing others. Because tobacco smoke is nasty bite on the eyes and smelly people around you and everyone within the restaurant Conclusion is that smoking is hazardous to health and people around him that the body fell down quickly. So I think we should care for each other well and exercise frequently together than to mess with drugs. All people should concern how dangerous of smoking, we should ban this seriously in order to save the next generations.
