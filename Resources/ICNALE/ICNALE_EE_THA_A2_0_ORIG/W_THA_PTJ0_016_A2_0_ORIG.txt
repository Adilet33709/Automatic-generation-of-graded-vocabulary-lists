I agree with the part-time work because of the beneficial use of leisure time. I can have the money to spend on each of the study other. Many place to work, such as restaurants, convenience store, shopping mall, dress store. Go to work after school better than go to party with friends. Have party with friends, we spend too much money. I can't save money but if we go to work. We have money to save. Father and mother will happy if we can have money by ourselves. When I spend money that I have from work, I feel happy because it is my money. The money that my father and mother give to me, I save it and pay for study. Work also help me to strong and be adult. I know to decide when I have problems in work. I know how to talk to boss, friend, buyer. I try to make everyone happy. When I am at home, I do reports, homework. I will read book because I know I don't have too much time to read book but I try to do my best. It is very good to work when I am a university student. I can feel I grow up.
