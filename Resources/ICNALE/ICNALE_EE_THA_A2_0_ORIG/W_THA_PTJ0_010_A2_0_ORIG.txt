In my opinion, Part - Time Work is a job in which an employee does not work full in hours or not a permanent job. So it stated like that because we don't have to do it like a serious stuff not like study. However, I think having a job is important but I will suggest someone that want to work part time job that don't overdo it, but working is necessary to gain experience before graduating from university. Many students work part time jobs to supply themselves with additional funds. Working part time is ideal for students, since it allows them to balance their academic needs with their school needs. Often, a school will provide a list of available part time jobs for the benefit of students, and many college towns deliberately tailor their openings for students. They don't have a lot of hope for the future, except that it won't get worse. I support that if we want to help family and pay extra we have to do part time job. For example, if parents pay 5000 baht per month, have to pay for dormitory for 2500 baht, we have only 2500 baht to spend. We have to eat and pay for many things. We shouldn't ask with parents more. We should find job to reduce the money from parents. They will not tired to work because they are old.
