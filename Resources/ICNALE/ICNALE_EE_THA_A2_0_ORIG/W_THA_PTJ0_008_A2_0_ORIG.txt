When students are available from school, it is a good idea to have part time job. The benefits for having part time jobs are as follows. Firstly, students have extra money for school. Students can help family to support themselves by earning money from part time job. There are some places that students can do part time job when they are free during the weekend or weekend such as cinema, food shops, passengers and etc. Many students can have income when being as college students that is very good to do because they will be very proud themselves. The extra money can also support their family because some of them may have some problem about financial. Many students have to drop school so they must help themselves. Second, experience, of course that gaining experience is important. In a present, many company require students to have experience so a student that got experience is better than non-experience. Last, making new friends. This is a small part but I think it's interesting to have new friends in part time job. We can share our knowledge and share other experience. We learn and understand each other. It make us to be friendly and easy going. So I think not just only three points, but many points to have part time job.
