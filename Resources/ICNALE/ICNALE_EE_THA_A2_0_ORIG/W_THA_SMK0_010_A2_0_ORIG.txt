I do not agree with smokers who being able to smoke in any places not only in the restaurants. Smokers should take a break to smoke which other are not satisfied with it. Smoking may be suit for some party but not in the restaurants because it's place for being pleasure with food. I wouldn't like there to be any smoking in the building but do not have any objections to people smoking outside. I do think that people should be made more aware of the damaging effects from smoking. I find it unpleasant when people are smoking just outside the exits to the building as you are forced to breathe in the smoke. Many people can't breathe because it's very stingy and hard to take a deep breath into the body. So in my point of view, it is good idea to say that smoking should not be allowed in the restaurants, university, workplace, and many places that many people are in. Smoking should be outside only at lunch times not have regular breaks and smoking should be banned at all workplaces or any public places. I hope to see this can happen in my university too. Want to see non students smoke also.
