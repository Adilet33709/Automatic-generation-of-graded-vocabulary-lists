All of students at university must use a lot of money because life at university has different from high school. It has many new things to pay such as we must pay a lot of books for use in learning. Then we should have a part-time job because students like us must pay a lot of money not only buy books but also we use money for buy cloths, for travel with friends and for use at the entertain things. If all of students have part-time job is very interested because we can have money by myself and part-time job can help us for manage time don't waste time at dormitory in play game online or chat online and sleep in the bed. If we have part-time job at university I think it can help us for future career because we can manage time and service. Part-time job is very important for all of students but it can damage us if we cannot manage time for study and job. Then if we want to have part0time job we should make sure that we can manage time for study and for job don't fail of both. I don't disagree to have a part-time job but students should know what is benefit or necessary for them to do.
