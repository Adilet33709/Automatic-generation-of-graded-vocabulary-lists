Yes, I do agree if student needs to do the part time after school. Right now the economy in Thailand isn't good at all, many people get lay off from their works and also hard to find a job even though you're a bachelor's degree student. To get a job in Mac Donald or some restaurants it doesn't make a lot of money but at least you can get experiences which valuable more than money. if you compare student who have been working and have an experience to another student who haven't been working nor have any experience, I think the one who worked have more opportunities. and it's also help out his or her family. Use their time wisely and not wasting time by getting a job is much more better. Many students get a better life from do the part time after school. We should not wait for help from others. We must help ourselves first, then we will be strong and ready to fight with any difficult thing after graduated from university. Parents won't worry about us and they will watch over our steps to go to be successful in the future by our own. I want to see Thai students can survive by themselves not just wait for parents help only.
