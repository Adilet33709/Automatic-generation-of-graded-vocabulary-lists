I agree because the restaurant is what Each individual person or family to family to eat together. Happy to do business or otherwise. If the restaurant is smoke will cause the atmosphere to shop completely free atmosphere. Restaurants and considered to be one of cleanliness. Restaurants need to focus on cleaning because of health related to the customer if the restaurant where the smoke when Customers come to the restaurant would be something bad back too, and may result in the body of the restaurant to eat healthy is not good. A cornerstone of the restaurant will give customers the impression that Must depend on many things. The taste is delicious and it Environmental atmosphere shop must be good. To attract customers into the store when customers will feel comfortable and all ages to focus. So, the restaurant should not smoke to interfere with the dining customers. It can cause health damage as a customer. Elderly, we should respect each other. And sometimes may be residual smoke into the food if you are smoking in the restaurant. Finally, anti-smoking in restaurants that Deemed to be correct and proper place because the restaurant is a place People that want to use something good. Not want the bad So who will enter the restaurant should consider whether the action should be what And considering that the penalty for smoking in restaurants would be wrong because it would destroy the healthy people.
