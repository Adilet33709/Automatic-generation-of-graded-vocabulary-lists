In present many teenagers use the money to wasteful so some teenagers find for the method in order to give more money to use. That method is having part time job after school. Teenagers be trained about science and theories at school is not enough to prepare them for adult life, parents must think about a way to make them familiar with the older, tougher and wider world by the encouraging them to take a part - time job. Once in a while I indulge and spoil myself with something expensive. Since I was working, my mother declared that she was cutting off my allowance. When she was still giving me allowance, the phrase spending money like water was all too familiar with me. There was this a little store in the mall called Sanrio Surprises where all my money would flow. Anything new there was what I invested my precious allowance in. It did not even matter what it was or how I was going to get it; I just had to get it no matter what. The best reason for encourage the teenager to take a part time job is to make them learn how hard money is earned.
