Jobs for students We buy with money ant it is the basic need of man. We do many thing for the sake of money, without the money acquision of everything is impossible. Education is very expensive in our country and we cannot get education without money, therefore a student always busy in the search of good and respectable job. It is essential need of students. A great problem of our country is that the opportunity of jobs is very lags and the working hours are not set according to hardworking and labour. A student, want that type of job, where he spend little time on job and get the handsome income I the return of his work, but it is not possible for him. The employers of every field want more and large work in the return of small income or sallery with labours. We have two way, either the free education for everyone, either to produce good jobs for students according to the expenditures of their education. It is government responsibility to think about this huge and dangerous problem, of government apptoprote large funds for education and for poor students. We can easily take this problem. A student is the future of the nation, if we do not pay attention on this problem, we will lost our future.
