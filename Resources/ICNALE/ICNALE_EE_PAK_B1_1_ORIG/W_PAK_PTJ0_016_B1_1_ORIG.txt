Part time jobs are those small jobs which students at college level do along with their studies. The students are bound to do these jobs because they have no other way and their parents are poor so they cannot afford their children dues. The student does jobs in different small places. Their health is affected by doing part time jobs. They cannot study seriously. Their result goes down. With the passage of time when the burden of work increases on them. They become sick due to the work. They cannot take leave for even one day in college the lessons are left and salary is lessoned. So they cannot rest they have to go to college in morning and job in evening and after that they have to study. The students who are only studying have better results than the students with jobs. The government is doing nothing for these students and N G O or any other institution is working on this project. Government should collect funds for these students who are facing many problems in society. The youth is damage and is in danger. If they cannot seriously study obviously they will not have better jobs in future and cannot participate in the development of their country. In Pakistan a country, which is underdevelopment this country is facing many problems and students are facing this type of problems due to poverty. We should also do something for it.
