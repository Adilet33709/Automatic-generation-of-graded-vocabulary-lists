Part time jobs are those activities which one performs other than his actual job or work. These jobs provide an opportunity to the people to earn extra income and improve their lifestyle. As for as the students are concerned, part time jobs could be very useful for them. It not only helps then to contribute to their family income but also physically and mentally prepared them for their future jobs. The first day of a student in college is full of excitement and enthusiasm. Gradually as the time pass by he become dull and bored because he has a huge burden of studies on his head as he does not get only time to relax and enjoy. Part time jobs can help them to reorganize themselves and to refresh. As it is famous proverb, All work and no play made jack a dull boy. In a part time job a student meets different people knows more about the social behavior. Then he sometimes gets appreciation and sometime he is scolded by his head officer. It provides him a physical activity and mental refreshes. After doing part time job he gets some time to his college homework. I think that a student can get more appreciation if he secures a position even he does a job alongside it as compared to a student who secures a position by sitting all the day and reading his book.
