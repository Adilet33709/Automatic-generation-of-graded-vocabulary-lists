I am a student of B. S. honours. This is my first year is education subject. My father is a very poor man. He is very hardworking. We are six brothers and sisters. We all are going to learn studies in different classes. I am a big brother all of us. My parents could not bear the income of our schools and colleges. I love my father and my family so much. For Lessing the burden of my father, I am doing part time job in a primary school. Because in this way my expenses are so much and my father can not bear it. I am found of reading; therefore I can not stop it. Due to part time job our parents feel relaxation. My free time does not waste in this way. Due to this our income became increased. I want to became and independent person. We fulfill our needs easily. We learn in this way new abilities, discipline, honesty, bareness, caress etc. On the other hand if it has many advantages but it has also some disadvantages. My study time became disturb. I can not study in proper time. But I am happy for it. God always help me in my studies, and always show's me right way. Amen!
