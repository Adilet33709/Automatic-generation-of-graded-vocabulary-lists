I agree with the topic of this essay that smoking should be banned at all restaurants. Most of us have experience that the people usually start smoking in the restaurants. Since smoking causes many bad effects in our society, it must be banned in restaurants like places. Smoking can affects the women's, children's health and the smokers, lower the living standards of our society and pollute the environment. Women and children have a weaker immune system than men while it is scientifically proved that smoking is much more harmful for the people who inhale the smoke than the smoker itself. The people who breathe the smoke may get lung cancer, blood cancer, heart attack or have some respiratory problems for a long time. The smokers on their own also become weaker and easily having these diseases. Moreover the coming generation who see adults smoking may imitate them. Some of them think that it is the sign of becoming mature, which make them, start smoking earlier to satisfy the feeling of being an adult. Their health must be worse gradually while they are the bright future of their nation. Therefore, the efficiency and productivity in many fields of careers is decreased, which leads to a poorer society with the lack of high standard products and facilities for a comfortable life. In addition, the medicine and treatment fee for the people who are prey to smoking are so large that it takes a large sum of money of the government while these money can be used for other purpose like supporting the education, to increase their export business and also decrease the increasing rate of poverty. In conclusion, I think that smoking should be banned in all the restaurants, public places, colleges, offices and even on the roads are really beneficial to all of us because it save more people from having lung cancer and save the environment.
