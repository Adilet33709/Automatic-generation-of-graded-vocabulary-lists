Is a part time job important to university students? As a university student, I do not have a part time job. But I do think a part time job is quite essential to an undergraduate. There are several reasons behind. Firstly, university fees are high. Having a part time job, a student can earn money in order to pay for part of the fees in the university. This can ease the strain of the bread winner of the family. Secondly, having some working experience before graduated can be an advantage when you apply for jobs in the future. Employers in all companies will prefer to employ a person with rich experience than a person with none. Thirdly, having a part time job can practice the time management skill of a student. If you can do well in academic result and at the same time doing well in your part time job. You will absolutely be an expert in time management. As a result, a part time job is important to a university student. If you your academic result will be affected by having a part time job, it is better you stick to your studies rather than having a part time job.
