With many reasons, I support the smoking ban should be set to all restaurants. It is an action that harms our health, depletes money and causes many consequences. Smoking is definitely harmful to our health, whoever those smokers or non-smokers. As we know, a cigarette contains over 20 carcinogenic compounds, and the smog that smoker and non-smokers breathe in is the same. That means non-smokers in restaurants have equal chances to be killed by toxic smoke. Absolutely unfair. Cigarette smoking is a high cost activity. Many smokers pay more than $1000 a month for packages of cigarettes. Besides self-finance, the diseases as result of smoke habit increases the financial burden of health care units, as more and more money has to put into the budget for treatments like chemotherapy. If the smoke is not proposed, probability of people in touch with toxic gases increases and higher budget should be expected. Of course, smoke smells. These not only pollute the environment, but also reduce our appetites. The nasty smell often causes nausea and affecting the nature of dishes. One main point is, the smell would also come from smokers. Disgusting, right? There are always so many reasons to support the ban of smoke. From now on, public areas like bus stops and shopping malls have already assigned smoke ban, so why not in restaurants?
