It is true that having a part time job is one of those important things of University life. Student with part time jobs can often earn extra money and get different experiences through various ways. With a part time job, students could earn their own money, rather than keep getting financial aids from their parents. They can be financial independent and get involved in own fiscal planning and management. On the other hand, part time jobs are relative to different skills training and experiences. Students could have specific skills been trained by taking part in different types of jobs. According to the job nature, they may have experiences of being a tutor teacher, a waiter or waitress, a salesperson and of course anything you can imagine. Most of the experiences can help in future occupation, but one important point is does it related to your study or future planning? However, many others may claim that part time jobs are time consuming, and students at different stages of study should put academy at the front. From my viewpoints, University students should have good time managements, if not, part time job is a good chance for them to learn; also, nowadays we concern on multi-competencies, and that's why we have to study in University. Having part time job is a fantastic way to earn, and that should be proposed.
