It is not uncommon to find lots of university students are working hard on both their studies and part-time jobs. Many of them work the appropriate number of hours of their part-time job and find the balance to maintain their studies. There are several reasons for why it is important for university students to have a part-time job. The firs reason, actually, is that money is much more needed when they get into university. Because most of the university students want to be financial independently, which means they want to have their own source of income. In the light of this, many will choose to have a part-time job instead of asking money from parents. Having a part-time job, in my opinion, is a precious chance for university students to learn more about the society. Just as many said - university is a step stone to the real society. Students can discover much more than what they learn in the school and definitely can get the memorable experience of how the real working industry is being. Besides, they can get along with other people, who is having different opinion, life experience and even in different age. This can help them to explore more about the society. Students, however, need to maintain the balance between work and study. They need to control their time and effort to both work and study seriously. A part-time job, I think, is crucial for university students.
