Whether it is important for university students to have a part-time job or not really depends on particular students. If the living standard of a student's family is not sufficient to cope with the basic needs, the student may find a part-time job to supplement his/her family income, as university tuition fee in Hong Kong may still be unaffordable to some families, despite the fact that the students have already be subsided by the government. However, for students from ordinary families, that is, money is not of their utmost concern at this moment. I would say that the students should reverse more time to enjoy their university life. They could make use of their free time to join more activities and know more friends so that their social circle can be expanded, and at the same time developing interpersonal skills. They could try different things such as organizing an event or an orientation camp for other students. From that, leadership experience can be accumulated and it is useful for their growth. After all, most students will go to work after their graduation: there will be lots of chances for them to work and hence they need not to start working too early. Although some may argue that previous work on internship experience is important for their first graduated job. I will argue that employers look more on your interpersonal and communication skills than the so-called little "working experience" when you are finding the first job. All in all, university students should enjoy their life and accumulate more experience before starting to work.
