It is well known that smoking could lead to body damages, especially, respiratory cancers. But it does not scare people from smoking. According to the statistics shown on Government's webpage, there were 839, 900 smokers in Hong Kong in 2006, accounting for 14. 8% of Hong Kong residents aged 15 and over. Also, due to being criticized by activists, Hong Kong government can hardly legislate prohibiting smoking in Hong Kong, which is also against Human Rights. Smokers claimed they have the rights and freedom of smoking. In order to avoid the term'freedom' from abusing, it is then necessary to define what freedom is. Freedom, defined by dictionary, is a state of being free. However, does it really mean there is no limit or restriction in freedom? Freedom should be based on affecting no others; i. e. smokers should consider if there is anyone who does not want to passively smoke. I hate smoking and cigarettes; but I do not agree smoking should be completely prohibited at all restaurants. However, I think it is a better way to set up and distinct smoking and non-smoking areas at a restaurant. It could be a win-win situation to both smokers and non-smokers.
