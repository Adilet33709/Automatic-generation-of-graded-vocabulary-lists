Smoking has been quiet popular ever since the advent of cigarettes and cigars. The smokers claim that they can give an infinite list of advantages of smoking such as its ability to provide people with focus. The protestors, on the contrary, strongly require that smoking be completely banned at public places like restaurants. They argue on the basis that smoking severely damages human health. From my perspective, the latter opinion is more favorable especially when referring to the restaurants. First, allowing smoking will reduce the number of customers that come to the restaurant. When choosing which restaurant to go, the customers value the hygiene condition most. Since smoking not only does harm to the smoker himself but also to the people around them, it can drive away considerable number of customer. In addition, forbidding smoking in all restaurants can help a great many smokers to get rid of smoking habit. Most people fail to quit smoking just because smoking is usually inevitable when having parties in restaurants, because in such occasions, people always try to persuade others to smoke. These people hate smoking but they have to suffer from it against their will. Thus if smoking is banned in all restaurants, a lot of people used to yield to others persuasion can be relieved from smoking. In a word, smoking does far more harm than good to all people in the long term, so disallowing smoking in all restaurants is beneficial to all customers. Now that giving up smoking is one of the ultimate goals of the society, starting from restaurants is surely a wise choice due to the reasons stated above.
