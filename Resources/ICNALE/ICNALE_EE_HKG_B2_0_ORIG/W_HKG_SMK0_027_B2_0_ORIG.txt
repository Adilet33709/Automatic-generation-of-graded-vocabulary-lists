Smoking is an activity which will lead you to die as it will increase the probability for suffering from cancer and lots of different disease. However, there still lots of citizen in Hong Kong smoke. Government has done a lot of thing to ask the public to stop smoking. One of the methods that government has done is completely ban smoking at all restaurants. The supporters of this policy are mainly the people that didn't smoke. Their lots of research have showed that the second smoke or the third-hand smoke is harmful for human. Even if you are not a smoker, but someone smoke near you also decreasing your life. It is properly for them didn't want to sit near a smoking person. In this case, this policy has a great help to prevent the above situation. Of course, the smoker didn't disagree with this policy. To against this policy, the supporting reason of them is they think that they have the right to smoke any place when they want. Moreover, there are another party against this policy. They are the restaurant owner. They are afraid that it will affect their income when they stop the people smoke. In my opinion, I agree with the government policy. We cannot let the health of most people affect by few people money and freedom. This policy also will decrease the smoker amount. Because of above reason, it is a right decision to raise this policy.
