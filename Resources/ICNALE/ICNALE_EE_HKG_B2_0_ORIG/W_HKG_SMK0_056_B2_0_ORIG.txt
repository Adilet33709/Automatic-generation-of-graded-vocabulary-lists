Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. Many smokers would assert that smoking in restaurants is their private business, and as long as it is not illegal, they have the rights to do it. Be that as it may, this seemingly strong argument would probably far from being valid as they intentionally omit the prerequisite of freedom: their actions cannot intrude into others' freedom as well. Non-smokers also have the rights of not inhaling the stale cigarette smoke given out by smokers and they may feel uncomfortable when the air around them is bad. Moreover, passive smoking may affect the health of other customers in restaurants because the cigarette smoke is proved to contain a high concentration of carcinogenic chemicals. For this reason, it is a must to ban smoking in restaurants. Also, if smoking is allowed in restaurants, some chief and waters may smoke in their working environment. In some cases, the smoking residue may fall into the food to be delivered to customers. The contaminated food is not hygienic at all and when people intake it, they may easily get sick. Thus, for the same of the health of the public and hygienic issues, smoking should be banned at all restaurants.
