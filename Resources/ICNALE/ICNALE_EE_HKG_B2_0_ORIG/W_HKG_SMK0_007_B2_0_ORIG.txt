In a small and non-ventilation restaurant, there is full of disgusting smoke when you having meal. How do you feel? Obviously, it's not acceptable. In my option, it's reasonable to ban smoking at all restaurants completely. Although smokers have their rights to smoke when they need, they also have responsibility to let non-smokers enjoy a clean environment. Sometimes, in order to be convenience, some smokers just throw the cigarette ends on the floor inside restaurant. I think nobody would like to have meal at these dirty restaurants. Hence, the income of restaurant will be affected directly. Nowadays, more people concern about the issue of smoking ban as they are alerted the hazard of second hand smoke. The second hand smoke is as harmful as first hand smoke. For an hour meal, the smoke irritates our respirational system a lot. Because of the smoke, non-smokers have a greater chance to suffer from some deadly diseases like lung cancer. All in all, preventing the others to be suffered and having a nice meal, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants as soon as possible.
