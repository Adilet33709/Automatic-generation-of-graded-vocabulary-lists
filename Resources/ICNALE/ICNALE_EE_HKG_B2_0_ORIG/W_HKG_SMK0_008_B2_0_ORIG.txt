Smoking in restaurants is a crime against humanity. It is a travesty, a blemish on the fabric of human society, a glitch in the Matrix. It is an enemy of the human race; like Moby Dick to Ahab, like Voldemort to Harry Potter, like Twilight to literature. It is the reason cavemen killed each other, the reason weapons were invented, the reason Hitler waged war. Convincing me that smoking in restaurants is acceptable on any level at all is like convincing a blind man to buy a 3D HDTV; it simply does not compute. I am not talking about the health risks caused by smoking. Respiratory illnesses, lung cancer, the Black Plague for all I care. It is your lungs breathing the smoke, your money paying for it, and your brain deciding that this somehow makes sense. You, however, are not going to smoke within any reasonable radius of the untainted pink lungs that belong to me. A restaurant is a public place. A smoker loses the right to do what he pleases when his actions infringe upon others and their ability to do what they please. Banning smoking is not a way of infringing on your rights, it is a way of making sure you do not infringe on mine. Forget all that; this is eating we are speaking of! Food is a beautiful mix of sights and smells, a confluence of aromatic explosions. Dining is an experience, and the culinary arts are the pinnacle of human achievement. A good meal is the work of an artist. Any chef worth his weight in salt (or soy sauce, since we are in Hong Kong) will shriek in horror if it is known that the splendid scent of tobacco is going to infuse itself into his work of art. So for the sake of human decency, could we please put the damned cigarette down and enjoy our meal?
