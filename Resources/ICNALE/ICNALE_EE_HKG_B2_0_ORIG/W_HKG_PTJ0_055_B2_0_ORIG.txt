Taking up a part time job would have more disadvantages than advantages for university students. For university students, the utmost important task for them is to gain academic knowledge and learn how to deal with the real world situation. Therefore, one should consider whether a specific activity benefits university students according to these two criteria. Certainly, some will argue that part time job is just aiming to equip students with the experience to handle problems occurring in the society. However, part time job will not be the most efficient way and rather, it causes dramatically shrink in the students time devoting in academic study. For most families in Hong Kong, covering tuition fee to finish university by the family will not be problematic. Most students do not carry heavy financial burden so that part time job is not necessary for students to earn money. Alternatively, students could choose to take part in internship provided by the university in order to approach the world outside university. Compared with part time job, internship could be more well-designed in terms of improving personal leadership, communication, cooperative skills. Thus, university students are recommended to reduce their time involved in part time job.
