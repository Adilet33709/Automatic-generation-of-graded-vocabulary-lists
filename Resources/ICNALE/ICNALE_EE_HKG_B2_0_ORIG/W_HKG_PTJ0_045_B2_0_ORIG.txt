Stepping into university, it symbolizes that students are getting near to adult's society. Besides celebrating for having independency from family, it also means students shall possibly be responsible to their own financial situation. Based on different reasons, many students would apply for part-time jobs. Some wanted to gain in work experience. Some wanted to earn money for luxuries. And some needed money to reduce financial pressure of the family. It is fair to say that their reasons are understandable. However, no matter how fancy their reasons are, it is for sure that having a part-time job could affect students' study due to fully packed schedule and disturbance in study. For university students, they shall equip themselves in order to face the upcoming challenges when he graduates. Regarding to the term "equipping", some part-time jobs actually helps students learn many and let themselves to get ready for their future careers. But, on the other hand, some only give students salary but nothing else. I sometimes questions the students what they really expected from the job. I disagree if they expect for money only to have a part-time job; but encourage them to get themselves ready for challenges.
