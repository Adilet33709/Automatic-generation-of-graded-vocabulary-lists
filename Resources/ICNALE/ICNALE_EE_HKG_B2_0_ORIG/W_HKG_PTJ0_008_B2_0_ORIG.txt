I think there are several reasons it is important for university students to get a part-time job, and I outline two of them below. The first is that part-time jobs are a valuable way to see how what students have learnt in class applies in the real world. Classroom education, especially at the university level, tends to be academic and theory-oriented. There is often little opportunity to see how these theories apply in practical usage. A part-time job in the same field as the student's degree will allow them to learn from professionals who apply these concepts on a daily basis. This will be a useful contrast from university classes, which are almost always taught by researchers. The second benefit of obtaining part-time employment alongside higher education is that it gives the student opportunities to pick up skills that they will need later when they enter the workforce, but are not taught in traditional university curricula. These include interpersonal skills and effective communication. University education is primarily designed to test whether the theoretical concepts taught have been learnt with sufficient clarity. When students enter the workforce, however, they often need to apply these concepts in concert with their colleagues. This will require them to communicate effectively and clearly. A part-time job will definitely give them an opportunity to exercise and improve this set of skills.
