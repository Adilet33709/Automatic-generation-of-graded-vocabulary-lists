Smoking should be banned in any public areas, surely including restaurants, considered all the potential damages to the health of the smokers and the people around them. At the same time, restaurants are supposed to provide a pleasant dinning atmosphere to their customers so that they can enjoy their meal without annoyed by the terrible smell. It is universally accepted that smoking can lead to severe damage to respiratory system of smokers and even people who smell the smoke. Restaurants are usually crowded with people so that it is not practical to separate smokers with non-smoking customers. Nor is it possible to prevent the diffusion of the cancer-caused smoke. Therefore, it will be a public health issue to pose laws to ban smoking in restaurants. Moreover, it is the government's responsibility to ensure that everyone has the rights to enjoy their meals in a smoke-free environment. One might argue that smokers should also have their freedom to decide when and where to smoke. However, when they smoke in public, others are deprived of the freedom to choose their dinning environment. They are forced to intake the smoke while they are eating. If you consider the fact, smoking in public is just like any other forms of crime, to satisfy one's needs in sacrifice of others' legitimate rights.
