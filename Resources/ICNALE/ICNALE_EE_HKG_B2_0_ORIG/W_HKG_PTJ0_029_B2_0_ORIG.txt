The university students are becoming better and better in finding ways to enrich their campus life. Apart from joining sports teams and student societies, having a part-time job is certainly among the top choices. The importance of part time job is recognized by a great number of people, me included. Most students go to university to prepare themselves to blend into the society in the future. Being successful in the society calls for skills of working and cooperating, which can be developed from part time jobs. For instance, one can learn how to set the working agenda and get help from colleagues. Without these skills, even if the student gets a good occupation upon his graduation, he/she will possibly feel it difficult to get used to the job, and thus his/her performance will not be satisfactory. Another advantage of having a part time job is that it offers some money, which the student can use to make their life more colorful. Such advantage is embodied by the experience of my friend Bill. He likes travel very much but he lack the money to do it often. However, that limitation is eliminated by the part time job he found. With his salary, he managed to travel to many places such as Singapore and Tokyo. Of course the salary can also be used to purchase a piano or football according to the interest of students. In conclusion, having a part time job brings a large number of benefits. Though it might be a bit difficult to find a satisfactory one, the outcome of the part time jobs is worth all the effort.
