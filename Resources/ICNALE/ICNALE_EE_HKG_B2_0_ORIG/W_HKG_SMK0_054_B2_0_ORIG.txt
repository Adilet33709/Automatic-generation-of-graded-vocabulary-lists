Smoking, as we all know, is harmful to our health. Thousands of lung cancer deaths were caused by smoking and breathing in secondhand smoke. As a non-smoker, I cannot agree with more for banning smoking at all restaurants. The secondhand smoke can cause many innocence persons to death. Many cases show that not only the smoker, but also the secondhand smoker will be suffered from different kinds of diseases, e. g. Lung cancer and heart disease. Therefore, the restaurants, where we go very often, should ban the smoking to avoid innocence people breathing in the harmful smoke. Smoking be banned at all restaurants can show the support of the local government for non-smoking environment and for the sake of the health of its citizen. People will be more awareness about the harm of smoking if the government ban smoking and promote non-smoking life. The most important thing is that restaurants are places for people to gathering with families and friends. How can you enjoy a dinner with the forced secondhand smoke breath? It cannot help even if the restaurant has divided its area to smoking and non-smoking area. The smoke can still be circulated at the restaurant. Smoking should be banned at all restaurants to provide citizen a comfortable place for dining. Last but not least, smoking is not good for anyone. We should all support non-smoking environment and pursuit a healthy life.
