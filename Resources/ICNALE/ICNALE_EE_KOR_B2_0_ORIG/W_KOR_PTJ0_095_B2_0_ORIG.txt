I am going to write as a college student. First of all yes. I agree with the topic. Doing part time job is essential for the students especially college students. But it costs a lot to go to the university. Most college students lack both time and money in Korea. Of course it's important to earn money but all of the universities require money too much. Most students can't afford the money by themselves. Me either. I think we should go abroad or experience many of things we haven't done instead study all day or work every day and stay home. I insist it is important to do a part time job but I hate how we have to do a part time job. Anyway we can learn many things from doing part time job. Such as endurance, responsibility and conversation skills etc... I think these are much more important than the money we earn from doing part time job. We can also learn how to use our time efficiently. To be at work on time, we schedule. That is how we learn to use our time. In addition typically it's boring to do a part time job. So I do some exercise or read a newspaper when I am free during the work. You don't? But I do!
