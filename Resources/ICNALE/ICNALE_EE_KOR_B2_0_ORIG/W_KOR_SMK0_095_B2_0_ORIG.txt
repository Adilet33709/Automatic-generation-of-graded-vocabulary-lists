You are right. I agree with the topic. Smoking is terrible, awful and very bad. Smoking must to be banned at not only restaurant also any public places! But I think smoking has been banned at a restaurant already. Hasn't it? Imagine you eat at a restaurant and someone smokes next to you. I wouldn't eat anything if I were you. You lose both money and health if you smoke. Eventually you pay for disease. What a silly! I work out. So I've never smoked and I don't even drink. But my father has smoked for over 20 years. I worry about his health. Smoking ruins also family. Parents need to stop smoking for the children. Last week I saw something about smoking on a newspaper. The government said that now it's illegal to smoke on a road or a square. I love that. I am done talking about smoking. What else can I say is smoking is worse for other people than the smoker! In addition Smoking makes people stink. Who would want to hang out with smelly person? Right? Ok I need more thirty words. I hate to tell someone stop smoking. So smokers need to stop smoking. Let's quick smoking!
