I think that college students have a part-time jab before graduating from university. Because they didn't have any experience about a part-time job, they will be embarrassed in society. In my case when I was a fresh man, I worked Lotto Riau as a part time worker for one year. And my parents recommended me to have a part-time job before going to army. I think it was good experience for me to meet various people and got little money. Even though I got living money from my parents, that was not enough to live. But since I had a part-time job, I could live better than I didn't have it. There is a bad aspect. It means I couldn't concentrate on my study. After working for 6 months, I thought whether I stop working or not. My choice was keep it going. At that time, I was young. So I had many chance in future and I had to go to army. Now I don't regret it. If I turn a fresh man, I would work also. Some people think having a part-time job is spent time in their life. Otherwise people who would have a part-time job, they will be succeed than no having experience. If you are living in Korea, I want you to have a part-time job when you are young.
