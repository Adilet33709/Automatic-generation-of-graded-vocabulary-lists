Most college students get a part time job even during school days. Needless to say, lots of students try to get a job in summer or winter vacation. All because they have to make a living for themselves. College registration fee is expensive they say, and I agree. It's hard to imagine our parents paying up all those moneys. That's why we need part time jobs. Although some do it because they do need money. I say part time jobs are good experience for all of us. But bad if the students try to make part time jobs as their eternal job. Some don't go to school at all'cause of it. Anyways, even with all their hard effort trying to earn, the regular wage rules are not being kept. My friend was working in an internet café for 3000won an hour. It's not fair. How can he make a living out of it? It should be increased or people should observe the rules. I intend to get a part time job in summer. But I don't want to work under these circumstances. But I need money which makes me that I have no choice. I somehow wish this could all change for all of us.
