One year's age, I had a part time job which was a cahier. While working cashier, I felt several disciplines. At the time, I spent money in clothes, accessories, rings. I didn't know money value. But, I worked myself so I regretted my spending. I knew that my parents did hard work. And I felt studying. While working, I wanted to study. Study is very easy work. I knew that I dislike physical work. I wanted to work that is knowledge. So, I always write my income and outcome. When I got some pocket money, I didn't spend it. Everything was saving at my account. And I really hard study for I get my knowledge. Part time is so very value experience. If I had not worked part time job, I would have realized money value and studying value. It gives me high mental quality. I think that people must part time job at young age. These days I get high English mark and am be good student. I must not forget my part time. My experience is so informative and helpful. I want to work another job so I want to know another value. My children suggest that part time is so good experience.
