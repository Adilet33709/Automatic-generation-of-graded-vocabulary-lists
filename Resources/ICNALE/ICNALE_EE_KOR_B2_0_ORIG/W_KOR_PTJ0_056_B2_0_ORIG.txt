Part time job is a way to look for my job. We can also experience many jobs through the part time job. It is very important to experience other jobs because we don't know that what we are interested in and want to be. So I think it is very good ways. I had part time jobs several times. It was very hard experiences but it is great time for me. When I needed money I sold clothes last year. I worked on the department store. It was very hard and I really wanted quit so fast. But I needed money to travel abroad so I couldn't do that. When I was 21, I worked at theater. It was very interesting times but I stressed about money. Because I checked money and calculated money exactly the theater earned money. I also worked at buffet. The work was very hard but eating delicious food was very good. Sometimes people gave me tip so I thought it was a cool job. Few months ago, I taught middle school students. It was hard work too because middle school students were not listen my speeches. I think many jobs that I experienced are going to be good sources in my future. Someday, you can experience many part time jobs too.
