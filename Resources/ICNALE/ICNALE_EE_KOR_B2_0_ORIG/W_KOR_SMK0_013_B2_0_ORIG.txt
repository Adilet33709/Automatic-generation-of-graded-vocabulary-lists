I agree that smoking is banded at all restaurants in the country. A few years ago, smoking was not important all of us. But now, people's thinking is change. Comedian who is Lee Jug-el, he died of illness that is the lung cancer. Until now I can't forget about that he said to the public about smoking. He was smoking for many years. Before he died, he made an authorized advertising. In an ad, he appealed to people who are smoking for many years. He said when you are smoking; you have to stop smoking, if you don't that that destroys your family and life. For example, a man is smoking at the restaurant; we think that he is polite. When he is smoking, he doesn't mind everybody in the restaurant. If he has a thinking that should take care of his family or friends, he can't smoke there. Now, people don't allow smoke in the building so we can see people who find the smoking area which is outside of building. Also, if someone smokes at the restaurant, cigarette smoke makes the people annoyed. We want to have the food in a fresh air and we don't want to die early because of cigarette smoke. So if you smoke for years, you have to stop smoking for your future, family, and friends.
