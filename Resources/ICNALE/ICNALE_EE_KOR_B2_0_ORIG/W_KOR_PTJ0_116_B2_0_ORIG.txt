During your college days, you don't want waste time but usually many student regret that you invaluably spend your time. But I think there are some ways not to waste your time, while you study at university. The one of them is to have a part time job. In fact, many students have a part time job, which is like waiter, cashier, seller, etc. , during your college days, to earn money, to get an experience or so. It is very helpful for student to get a job. And very important. Even though they don't have to get a part time job to earn money. So I will explain to you that why it is important. First, you can meet various people. Of course, you can meet people at your school but it is different between people whom you would meet at your workplace and people whom you would meet at your school. I think talking with various people gives you a lot of idea. Also you could have a chance to get information which you want to get. If you do part time job is related your future work, you can meet some people who have some information you need. It is more advantage than other people who don't part time job. Second, you earn money, having part time job. So you can realize how important money is and how to spend money. You could have a habit of saving money. Because you don't want to waste the money you earned. Some of student's waste money, but almost student doesn't waste the money they earned themselves. Thus I think during your college days, doing part time job is very helpful, valuable, and merited things. So. I recommend you to do part time job, while you are in university.
