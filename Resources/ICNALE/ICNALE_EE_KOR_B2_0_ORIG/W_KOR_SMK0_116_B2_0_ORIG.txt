Nobody agree with smoking is healthy. But there are some of people who don't want to quit smoking. They usually smoke everywhere; even they smoke in public place. I think they are addicted. So if it makes people feel uncomfortable, smoker should be banned from smoking in public place. As you know smoking causes so many disease, like a lung cancer, tuberculosis cancer, etc. it however, is not limits to smoker but second hand smoke do. So. Here is reason that why smoking is banned in public place. First, it causes much disease. If it is banned to smoke in public place, it could reduce people who smoke' rate. As a result, many people could be healthier. It is very easy for second hand smoke to get a disease from second hand smoking. So I think it should be banned to smoke in public place. Second, if it is banned, it could make Cleaner Street. Usually people who smoke throw away on the street. Even though there are so many smoking stands, they don't use that. As if it is very natural act. But I think if it is banned, they couldn't throw away a cigarette. So it would make street clean. Third. If it is banned, it could prevent from a big fire. Sometimes the cigarette you threw away could make a big fire. Of course, there is other fire of origin. But I think if you don't smoke in public place it also could reduce a fire rate. Thus I think smoking in public place is banned by government. If it does not it could make people get disease, it could make street unclean, uncomfortable, also it could make a big fire. So I believe that it should be banned to smoke in public place.
