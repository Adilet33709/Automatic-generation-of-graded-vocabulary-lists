Smoking. Causing a lot of problems presently to students and adults. I bet our country is one of the places where people smoke the most. Honestly, I don't care whether they smoke or not. But students smoking? That's totally wrong. They're destroying their bodies completely before they even fully become an adult. They probably smoke because they think it makes them look cool. But yes, that is true. It does make certain someone who's smoking look cool. But does looking cool to other people are more worth than their own health? Lots of people regret when they get cancer or they make a hole through their neck. Before then, they can never realize how serious this is. Since smoking started to look cool, it's giving a really bad influence to little kids. The kindergarten children. I mean I saw them smoking not outside but on internet. Spitting saliva out of their mouth. That's not what kids should do. If the government wanted people to make them stop smoking, why didn't they raise the price of the cigarette up to hundred dollars? Who would dare to buy that? That would really help stop smoking. But then again cigarettes bring a lot of profit to our land. It cigarettes become illegal to sell, out country will get a big damage in the financial fees. I guess we can't make those people who smoke stop smoking. I just wish it doesn't get worse than this.
