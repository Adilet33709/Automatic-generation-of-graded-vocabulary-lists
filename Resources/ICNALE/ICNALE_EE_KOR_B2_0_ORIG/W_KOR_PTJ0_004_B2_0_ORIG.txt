I disagree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part time job. While it is true that college tuition fees are high these days, there have also been scholarships and loans being offered too. I believe that this has to take into account the idea of'opportunity cost'. Take for example the case of a student who is deciding whether or not to work to support his studies or to spend more time studying to obtain a better result. The student has the option of working harder and spending more time to study to obtain scholarship for his studies. The scholarship could solve the student's financial problems in addition to getting excellent results. I believe that this is an issue of investment of time. Students who do part time job are generally tired when they attend classes. This could affect their studies indirectly. A person could choose to instead invest his or her time on studies instead while applying for a loan to support the tuition fees. Being able to pay the tuition fees by working part time and being tired or sleepy in classes is not a good option. By doing the comparison, spending more time on studies thus getting better results and obtaining a scholarship is a better one. In conclusion, the statement that it is important for college students to have a part time job should be discarded as it is not a viable alternative of solving a person's financial constraint problems. It is not wise for a student to forgo his studies to support his or her school tuition fees.
