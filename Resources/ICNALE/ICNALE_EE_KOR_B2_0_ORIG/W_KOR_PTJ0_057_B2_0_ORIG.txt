I agree with the question. I have four reasons. First of all, I think it is important for university students to experience before getting a job. For example, if students who are finished university get a job and have to hardly work, they can not accuratly work. that is because they have not enough experiences. In the university, no one teaches excutive abilities. Second, lots of korean students do not know valuableness about money since lots of korean university students get a pocket money from parents. i think people who have never experienced about part-time job do not know notableness about money. Third, to know about spending money. I think a lot of student do not have experience to work as a part-time job and they do not know how to management spending money. Because they have never experienced working and earning the money themselves. so it is good at experience for university student to work as a part time job. Last thing is that they can know lots of people. If students who work part time job, they can be know a lot of workers than general university student. In Korean, it is important to know the people who is in the same part. consequentially, I agree with working part-time job for university students.
