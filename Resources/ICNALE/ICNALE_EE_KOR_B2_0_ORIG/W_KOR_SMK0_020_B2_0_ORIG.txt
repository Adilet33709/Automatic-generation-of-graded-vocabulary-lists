Smoking has always been issues of our society. Inflation of cigarette, smoking area, secondhand smoke, and etc. All over the world it seem to be quitting smoke one of the way is increasing the cost of cigarette, in South Korea this issue has been talked a lot but not seems to be working bad, recently the cost of cigarette named Dunhill has been raised to reduce rate of the smokers, but people who smoked the Dunhill changed their kind to cheaper ones, Secondly smoking areas are not appointed well this cause people to smoke in bus stops, inside the building, and public areas in Canada it is illegal to smoke inside the building and public areas. This should be put into action in Korea. And the last one is secondhand smoking this issue is related to the smoking area issue I guess most of people know secondhand smoking is worse than smoking, secondhand smoking can cause cancer, skin disease. A person I knew from my youth she was healthy but she died from lung cancer from secondhand smoking her husband was a chain smoker. Me myself too I do not smoke in public areas because I know secondhand smoke is bad and I do not like the way the people see me. Smoking has always been issues of our society.
