I agree with the question. According to the news in the korean TV, from 2013 smokers can not smoke in the public area from 2013. I have four reasons about the question. First of all, if smokers smoke in the restaurant, they influence other customers. Guess other customers in the restaurant eat some food and smokers are smoking next to table, visitors really do not like smells and disgusting. I think it is not good smoking in the public area. second of all, smoking is not good at heath. According to the newspaper I saw, smoking is damaged smokers lung and they can not live long than non-smokers. Smoking take a toll to the lung and prompt cancer of the lungs and lots of disease. Third, if smokers are smoking in restaurant, other non-smokers are damaged from smokers. I mean second-hand smoking. I read some result of the second-hand smoking. It said that non-smokers is damaged if they smell tobacco. What was worse it too day as smoker. I was surprised about that result. Last reason do not smoke in the restaurant is I think the first important thing in the restaurant is clean. If smokers are smoking in the restaurant, lots of place in the store are duty than banned smoking restaurant. Because smoking makes the place duty. Finally I think smoking must injunct in the restaurant.
