I have two opinions of this Topic. And this opinion divided two part of view point. That is, an economic point of view and social point of view. First. Nowadays, College tuition is more expensive than others. So it is a burden to many students and parents who have no money or ordinary people. For this reason. Student should work for making money of college tuition. If students make money for tuition, it will reduce a burden for college tuition. Or students need to make a pocket money. Because, college students is an adult. Now, they need to time of economic independence. And they no more get the money for there's parent. Second. To have a part-time job is indirect experience of social life before we join in society. For this experience, we learned that earning money is very hard and difficult what I experienced before. And we will experience human relationship of social life. In this society, lots of people who have diversity are existed in our society. Through this we can learn how to handle these people who have diversity. And meeting in the diverse people, we can learn development of relationship in the social life. To conclude, to have a part time of job is giving a many experience before join in society
