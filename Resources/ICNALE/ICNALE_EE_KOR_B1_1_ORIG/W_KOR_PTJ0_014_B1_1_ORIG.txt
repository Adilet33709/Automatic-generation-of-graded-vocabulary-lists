Have you ever get to part time after teenagers? Most teenagers want to make money without supporting their parents. In my case I could lots of advantages when I worked in a part time job. First of all, I could make different kinds of relationships. As you know, if I got a new circumstance, we could meet many people. Every people makes you learn valuable things whether you like each person or not. Second, I could have good skills from a part time job. If you work at restaurant kitchen, you could cook foods well. Also, if you work apparel store in department store, you could give people good services and could match clothe well depending on each situation or purpose. Finally, you can learn how valuable money is and how to deal with money well. If you take money from your parents, you just waste money easily. However, if you earn money for yourself to buy something, you couldn't use your money easily and think very carefully when you decide to use that. Through my experiences, if you have an opportunity to work in a part time job, you can learn economical advantage and social advantage in your life.
