Smoking is very harmful to human being. But there are thousands of people smoking around the world even though they know smoking is harmful. The most serious problem is that non-smokers are damaged by second-hand smoking of smoker. Media has emphasized the dangerousness of second-hand smoking. Lately, the notion of third-hand smoking appeared. I have seen TV program about third-hand smoking. A father usually smokes outside and washes his hands with soap. He hugs his baby and plays with him or her after smoking and washing his hands. Even though the baby doesn't smell the smoke, dangerous stuffs are found out from skin of the baby. The research shows the baby has the same amount of dangerous stuff as adult smoker. I was shocked by the result of the research. After I saw this program, I realized that we can't escape from the dangerousness of smoking anywhere. Therefore, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Restaurants are public area where any people can drop by and use. In these area non-smokers are easily affected by smoker. Smokers have to know the effect of their smoking to others. Government should take a action for health of all citizen.
