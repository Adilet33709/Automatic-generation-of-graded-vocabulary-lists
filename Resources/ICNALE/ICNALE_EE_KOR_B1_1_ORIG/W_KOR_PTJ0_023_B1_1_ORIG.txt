Many university students having part time jobs. There are many different opinions about part-time job. Some parents think having part-time jobs can affect the students' study, therefore they are not allowed to have part time job. Others think having a part time job is a good social experience. Many students think that they can learn useful skills through various part time jobs. If you work in a supermarket, you can learn how to promote products. If you computer savvy, you can make homepages for additional cash. Also learn how difficult to earn money, then you will be more willing to study and saving money. I believe it is necessary for students to have a part time job for their future. Most of all, encouraging students to participate in a part time job may be beneficial for their future success. To be more specific, student will gain experience of what is like to live throughout the society, which means that they will be prepared for their future as they grow up. Moreover, encouragement for student to participate in a part time job will be positive for their future. Specially, participating in a part time job will not only give experiences but they also will gain money, of which they can spend it on things such as clothing. In addition, they will feel a great accomplishment that they bought things with their own money. So I agree with it.
