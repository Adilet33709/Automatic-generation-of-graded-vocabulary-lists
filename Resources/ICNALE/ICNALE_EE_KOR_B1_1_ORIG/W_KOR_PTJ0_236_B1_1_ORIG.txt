College students need lots of money because they have to pay tuition fee. Also they need fee of transportation and they have to buy lunch. All these expenses are very big deal to students. Registration of school is very expensive. Many students receive money from their parents but it is limited. Therefore, having a part-time job is required by students. Students can help their parents' worry by doing a part-time job. Even students are busy for school works, they can feel satisfaction. In my case, my parents give me money once a month. I have no part-time jobs. I have to spend money for reasonable price every time. Sometimes, I want to buy a brand-new clothe or an expensive bag. But my pocket has limit so I can't buy something that written on my wish list. If I have a part-time job, I can buy clothes or a bag. However, having a part-time job makes me tired and very busy so I don't want to have a part-time job. Gathering money is easier to me than earning money. On the other hands, in summer vacation or winter vacation, that is exception. In my free time like vacation, I find a part-time job because just I'm free!
