Some people who smoke are very rude. They smoke not only on the street, also in the restaurants. When they smoke in restaurants, other people who don't smoke feel upset. Smoking makes fumes and dirty dust. People who smoke have their smell of cigarette. That makes very discomfort. I think people who smoke in restaurants is selfish. They enjoy their smoking and do not care about other people who don't smoking. So what I am talking about is that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Some of restaurants have smoking seats, but there is nearby seats of no smoking. Fumes and durst move every table in restaurants. Guests in a restaurant might be angry if someone who sitting on their next table is smoking. Then, the restaurant is gossiped about their cleaning condition and etiquette. It is good choice to forbid smoking in restaurants for their owners. Restaurants are where people eat dinner. Maybe it is special dining for someone. Smoking can break into special mood. Apparently, It is very serious problem that smoking in restaurants. I wish that smoking is banned in restaurants as soon as possible. I want to eat dinner in a restaurant that no one smoking.
