Many people smoke at the restaurant today. It is very unpleasant and I also hate this. If I see most people who smoke when I have a meal, I will very angry. I also agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. There are two things why I hate people who smoke at the restaurant. First, smoking is not good for health. As you know, many people know this truth and smoking affects other people as well as the smoker. Many non-smokers are suffering from secondhand smoke. Therefore, banning smoking from all restaurants is the only way we can prevent the dangerous things associated with smoking. Second, non-smokers cannot enjoy their meal at the restaurant because of smoker. When I was having my meal at the restaurant, I couldn't eat any more because of cigarette smoke. So, I stopped eating meal. As always, many non-smokers are suffering because of smoker. In conclusion, smoking is not good for human's health as you know and we should protect non-smokers by banning smoking from restaurants. It is very important thing and smokers should not bother the non-smokers also. So, smoking must be perfectly forbidden at all restaurants in the whole country.
