These days, a lot of students have part-time jobs. On the Internet and newspapers, many companies are looking for students to work for them. I don't think, however, it is a good idea for students to work part-time while they are going to school. I also don't think it is necessary, because parents support them and pay for their expenses. In addition, having jobs has some negative effects. First of all, education is difficult and complex. To learn and get good grades, students have to study hard. They have to get up early to attend classes, and do their homework at home. It seems to be easy, but it is busy and hard. If students are working part-time after class, they are going to be tired, so it impacts on the next day. It will have negative effects on studying: they won't concentrate, and they will even be able to doze in class. Finally, it will impact on their grades. Finally, if a student works part-time, he may miss out on the fun of his life. He won't be able to play with his friends and enjoy his own spare time. In other words, if a student spends time on working, he can't enjoy his life. I think that a period of students is the freest time except studying. This is because their parents pay for their expenses, and parents help everything that they want. Therefore, students have to concentrate on studying. In conclusion, students' duty is studying. They have to study rather than work because having part-time jobs has some negative effects as above. A period of students is a favorable time to study.
