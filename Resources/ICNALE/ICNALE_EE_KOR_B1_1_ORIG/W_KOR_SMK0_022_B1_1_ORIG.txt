I think we should ban in public places completely. Because cigarette is harmful to the body. The reason is that the diseases related to the smoking can be prevented and fire hazards can be reduced. Above all, making a rule that restricts smoking in a public area plays an important role in preventing smoking-related diseases. This is because there are enormous kinds of carcinogens in the smoke of the cigarettes. The smokes full of harmful components that can cause a cancer, asthma, or other fatal diseases can affect not only the smokers themselves but also non-smokers around them. Thus by banning smoking in public places can reduce those risk of getting smoke-related diseases. Moreover, preventing smoking in public areas can contribute to decreasing dangers of the fire. The cigarette butts that are thrown away without being fully extinguished can cause irreversible disaster like the mountain fire. Lf you don't smoke, many helpful points. If people are smoking in designated a non-smoking area to try and get a little smoke damage will be reduced by the recipient. I have to everyone in the world for their families for health for all people is; I hope it does not hurt. Also lawyer should get a strong law for non-smoking.
