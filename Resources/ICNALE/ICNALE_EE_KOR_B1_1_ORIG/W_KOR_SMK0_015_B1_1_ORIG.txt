Some people think that ban on smoking at all the restaurants is bad. But I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are some reasons why I think so: other people's health, bad smell and clear environment of restaurants. First of all, other people's health is very important. But, if some smoker smokes at food restaurants, other people's health can be bad. Especially, if there are pregnant women, the old and babies, it can be very harmful to them. Second, people get angry if they smell bad smoke. Cigarette's smells very bad and it can make people feel unpleased. The people have a right to breathe good smell at food restaurant. Third, if heavy smokers smoke at food restaurants, the restaurant's environment can be dirty. The tobacco smoke can go into the food and the remains of cigarette can go into the food. Also, the food restaurants' furniture will be dirty because of cigarette. So, because of the three reasons, I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
