Some people think that teenagers have part-time job is bad. Because they think part-time job is a cause of their low grade. And they even think that the teenagers who do the part-time job are a delinquent student. But I think they are prejudiced. They can learn about economic strength. Besides, part time job has some benefits for teenager. So, in my opinion, teenagers having a job when they are still students are a good way of learning about society. Here are some reasons that why I agree for the teenagers having their jobs. 1 First, teenagers can know the value of money is worth as they earn money themselves. Most of the teenagers and children get pocket money from their parents. But they do anything in order to have money. They don't know how much they worked, and where does the money come from. If they have part-time jobs, they can know about it. So, part-time jobs can help the teenagers to take care of their money. Second, they can learn about many people and economic. For example, teens working in some place like'Starbucks', they can see a lot of kinds of people. Some people are younger than them, but many other people are older than them. They can learn saying, ideas, and attitudes. By doing this, they can be established right values. There are many good places where teenagers can work: convenience stores, fast food restaurants, parking assistants, etc. Teenagers can learn worthwhile things through their part-time jobs in a way they cannot through textbooks, doing assignments. Therefore, I agree with teenagers' job.
