Millions have died from smoking every year and it is a well-known fact. It is long proved that smoking not only harm themselves, but to others around them too. Exposing to second-hand smoke instead is more damaging than smoking itself. In Singapore, smoking in restaurants has already being banned. Not just restaurants, even in hawker centres and shopping centres only a designated area is allowed to smoke. Smokers on the other hand, think that this is against their rights and freedom. In my opinion however, yes, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. Primary reason people visit the restaurants is to eat, not to smoke. We have to consider the various health issues. In a setting like restaurants with air-conditioning, smoke can plague and stink the whole place. Smoke can also trigger asthma and irritate throats. Food can become bland and smells from the smoke nearby. It is self-explanatory that restaurants can lose non-smoking customers as a result. Smoking in the public has already influence and encourage the young to smoke. If places such as restaurants and hawker centres also allow smoking to take place, the young will undoubtedly learn to smoke from the adults. Hence, in my honest opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants and hawker centres.
