I agree to a limited extent that college students should have a part-time job. Part-time jobs that actively look into recruiting students usually belong to the service, food and beverage and retail industries. The jobs offered are usually on shift-basis with a minimum number of working days and working hours, giving students a considerable amount of flexibility when planning their schedule for the week or the month. Having a part-time job provide learning experiences for the student that they otherwise would not experience in school. Work commitment, managing relationships with colleagues, time management, stress management and learning new skills are some of the things a student can gain if they were to have a part-time job. By joining the workforce earlier, the student may enjoy an easier transition from their role as a student to being part of the workforce upon graduation. In addition, working part-time also encourages the student to be financially independent by earning their own allowance. However, having a part-time job can be time consuming because of the weekly commitment. The time that could have been allocated to assignment research or exam revision could be significantly compromised because of the job requirements. In addition, the fatigue and lack of rest can lead to unproductivity when the student eventually settles down to finish their schoolwork. This may impact their results and harm their progress in their studies. To conclude, I would recommend students to only look for a part-time job if they have limited income at home. Otherwise, students should fully immerse themselves in college life and enjoy the facilities while they have the luxury of time to do so. It is more important to enjoy their role as a student and to excel in it rather than to focus on getting a part-time job.
