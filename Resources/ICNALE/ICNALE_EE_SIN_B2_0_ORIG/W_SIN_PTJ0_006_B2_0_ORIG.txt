I find it hard to make a generalisation on whether it's important or not for college students to have a part-time job, because this seems like something very individual and highly dependent on the individual student and their circumstances. Jobs serve a few main functions: to earn money, to gain experience, to get a head-start in a career, and to have something to do. Whether or not it's important for a given college student to have a part-time job would thus be dependent on how important those various factors are for them. A poor student, for instance, would find a (paying) job beneficial or even necessary to meet their financial needs, and would find such a job to be more important for them than it would be for a rich student who does not have to worry about finances. Alternatively, a student might take up a job to gain experience and expand their horizons beyond the merely academic, and consider this an important pursuit. Another student might, however, find the time spent on a job to be better spent on their college work, studying and getting the best grades they can, so as to be able to (ideally) get a better job in future. Yet another student might wish to enjoy their last few years of freedom before entering the workforce, and find it more important to have free time to spend on leisure, rather than on a job. A final hypothetical student might meanwhile be already struggling with their college work (with or without additional commitments), and getting a job would further jeopardise their ability to cope. As such, while having a part-time job would be important for some college students, this assertion cannot be universally applied to all of them.
