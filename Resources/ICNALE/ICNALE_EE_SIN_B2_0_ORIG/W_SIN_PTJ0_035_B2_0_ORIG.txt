Having a part-time job while one is a student can be beneficial to him or her. Firstly, he or she is able to earn some money using his or her own effort. Secondly, it does not take up too much responsibility nor time, and in ideal situations will not distract the too much from his or her main occupation as a student. Moreover, one is able to make friends in his or her working circle, and understand how to navigate the working world after graduation. Many students take up tuition assignments which are ad-hoc and easy to manage around their time-table, while others seek jobs during the week-ends or at night, after their lessons. Part-time jobs are usually popular with people who have other more serious commitments, but have some spare time in which they would like a change in environment, or earn some money. Personally, I have worked as a packer at a florist's packing hampers during the Chinese New Year holidays. Although I was required to work overtime and was given minimal wages, I look back on those days with fondness now remembering my friendly co-workers and my pride in my first (albeit low) salary. I would highly encourage students to try out a variety of part-time jobs, so as to be able to try out different experiences, rather than opting for higher-paying, but boring jobs.
