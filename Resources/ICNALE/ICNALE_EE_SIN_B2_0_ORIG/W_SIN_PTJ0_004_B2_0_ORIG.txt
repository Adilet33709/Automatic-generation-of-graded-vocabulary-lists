It is not important for college student to have a part-time job as it may not offer what is required for the students. Whether a not college students need the job is dependent on their financial needs and also their priorities. College life may have long breaks in between the semesters which serve as a very timely period for doing a part-time job which can finance the students' expenses or luxurious spending such as getting a new smart phone or accessories. Students who have other priorities such as getting good grades or having a better portfolio would rather spend time doing an internship in a company or to prepare for the upcoming modules they have to take. For students who are financially burdened, a part-time job is important for them to fulfil their daily needs. However, for those who are not, it can merely serve as a mean to fill their excess time and it also comes with monetary reward. Some may argue that working part-time can help a college student manage their time more effectively, especially if the part-time job is done regularly during semester period as there will be lesser time spare for the student to do their academic work. However, having a co-curricular activity or taking up a leadership position in various groups can better enhance the students' college life. Therefore, I believe that the importance of having a part-time job for students in college is not necessary unless by circumstances or by the needs that the students have to satisfy.
