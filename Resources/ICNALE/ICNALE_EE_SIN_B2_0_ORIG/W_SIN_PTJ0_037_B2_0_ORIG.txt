College students are stuck in a strange period of their lives - they are expected to behave like adults in society, and yet do not the financial prowess of one. Mired in a busy schedule of academic work, the results of which will probably have a critical bearing on the rest of their lives, college students can sometimes barely find the time to enjoy an adequate social life, much less ensure a fixed income for their ever increasing appetite for spending and consuming. It is therefore exceptionally beneficial for students to partake in some form of temporary or part-time job in the hours outside of class that is able to support their growing expenditure; less reliance on parents' allowance or the need to scrimp and save, more self-sufficiency and growing pride in the ability to support themselves. While it is certainly good to be gain some financial independence, the trade-off for such part-time jobs would be time spent on studies, on making friends and networks that can only be gotten in college, and spending time on extra-curricular activities that will develop into useful skills and interests for life. Moreover, part-time jobs usually have meager pay, and the learning opportunities for a temporary staff member is small to say the least --- the returns on such a job can far outweigh its costs, and thus students may be better off not having a part-time job. It is thus sometimes far more important to make sure one is making full use of his or her college life - a once in a lifetime occurrence - rather than spend precious time slaving away for a little bit of money.
