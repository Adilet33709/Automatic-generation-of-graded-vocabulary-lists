 Ideally, I completely agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Through this, there will be many advantages that will benefit most of society. Banning smoking in restaurants would encourage more smokers to cut their smoking habits since they would have a hard time finding a place to take a puff. Additionally, the ban of smoking will encourage a more healthy environment in restaurants since they will not be any second-hand smoked inhaled by customers. This is especially important for family-friendly restaurants with children since children are at a higher risk of being affected by secondhand smoke. However, I feel that it is impractical for smoking to be banned at all the restaurants. Smokers would feel that they are not given the space to smoke and would feel discriminated at such policies. Additionally, restaurant owners may not be happy with such a rule as it could turn away customers who are smokers from frequenting their restaurant. Therefore, while it is ideal that smoking should be banned from all the restaurants, it is not practical to do so especially when smokers account for quite a percentage of the society. I believe the type of restaurants should determine if smoking were to be banned or not.
