Some people believe that as college students, we should not have part-time jobs as that will leave us less time on our studies, which is what our primary responsibility is. However, I agree that it is beneficial for college students to have a part-time job, if they have good time management. Firstly, getting a part-time job is the first step to learning how to be independent, and university is the best time to do so. As university course choices and education is more self-directed than in junior college or high school, most college students have much free time on their hands. Having a part-time job is thus a good way of making use of their time wisely, and earning their own income at the same time. Secondly, a part-time job can act as a bridge between college education and their careers in the future. This is especially so when their part-time job coheres with what they hope to do in the future, for example, some students may choose to take up a part-time job in healthcare institutions if their course of study is healthcare-related such as nursing, medicine or pharmacy. Their part-time jobs will allow them to get a better understanding of how the industry/organisation really works, and thus makes their learning more meaningful. Even if their part-time jobs are different from their courses of study, students will still be able to learn universal skills like teamwork, communication skills and the importance of spending money wisely that will help them in their future. In conclusion, it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
