I feel that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. In fact, I feel that smoking should be completely banned. Smoking has been known to cause heart disease, stroke, asthma, etc. Cigarette smoke also contains a great number of harmful carcinogenic chemicals, and greatly increases the individual's risk of developing cancer, especially lung cancer, later in life. Smoking in pregnant women can lead to stillborns, miscarriages, prematurity, and low birth weight. In fact, a study in the United Kingdom showed smoking to cause more deaths than drugs, alcohol, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), suicide, homicide, and car crashes combined. How can Singapore, who has such severe punishment (caning, hanging, etc. ) for drugs, allow this even bigger mass murderer to continue to go scot free? That is not to mention that in the case of drugs, there are a number of drugs that have no long-lasting ill-effects on drugs. Also, usually, only the drug users themselves suffer from adverse health effects from the drug. But that is not so in the case of smoking. Smoking not only causes long-term harm on the user himself, but also for the people around them. It can even be argued that more than the smoker himself, passive smokers suffer worse ill-effects. Most cigarettes have filters that filter out most of the harmful carcinogenic chemicals, preventing the smoker from inhaling them in. Second-hand smokers on the other hand, do not have the advantage of the filter, and breathes in all the second-hand smoke. Hence, according to Mill's Harm Principle, we should completely ban smoking.
