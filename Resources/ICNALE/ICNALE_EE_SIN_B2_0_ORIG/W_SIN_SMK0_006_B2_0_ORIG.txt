I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, for the reason that smokers are (usually) people too. While it is definitely unfair to subject innocents to their second-hand smoke when they're trying to eat, it would also seem unfair to make it impossible for smokers who enjoy smoking before, during or after a meal to do so when eating out, especially in cases where it would not affect others. As someone who is personally hypersensitive to smoke and other funky nasal intrusions, I do believe that certain areas - especially in restaurants, where smell is an important part of the experience - should be kept smoke free. However, when it comes to bigger restaurants in particular, and those that are open-air, having a separate smoking section away from the rest of the restaurant patrons would not hurt anyone. Smokers would get to smoke, non-smokers would get a smoke-free environment, the restaurant would get more money, and everyone would be happy until they see the bill. Alternatively, there could be some restaurants that allow smoking while others ban it completely, and if non-smokers want to eat at a smoking-allowed restaurant, they'll just have to put up with the smoke as a compromise. Likewise, if a smoker wants to eat at a no-smoking-allowed restaurant, they'd also have to compromise by, well, not smoking. Diversity is key: having more options available to meet everyone's needs as best as possible, harming as few as possible in the process. Absolutism of any sort is terrifying, and should never be allowed to stand anywhere outside of a totalitarian society.
