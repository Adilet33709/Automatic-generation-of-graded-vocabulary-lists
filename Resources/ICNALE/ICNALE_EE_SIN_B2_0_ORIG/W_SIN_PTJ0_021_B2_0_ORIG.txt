Having a part-time job as a college student can both be a bear or a bull. It all depends on the students' willingness and openness in welcoming the job or not. It is never said that college students should be working part-time and I can double confirm my both parents are very against the idea. In many ways, working part-time is very time consuming. It will take off a large period of time off the students' already hectic life. Students would have to juggle between study and work which will definitely results in poor grades. Having to work part-time during my holidays can prove my point that it is never easy to balance between work and play, what is more of studying? However partaking in a part-time job to some is a two edge sword. To some, it is necessary. Poverty stricken kids need to work to pay college fees while others see it as an opportunity to get first-hand experience on work life after graduation as an adult. Hence, I disagree that it is important for college students to hold a part-time job while studying to a certain extent because students' job already is to study, unless there is a compelling reason to work such as exposing to a golden opportunity for learning. In contrast, I think that high school students should get a part-time job instead because the amount of work loads they get is much lighter and no internships for them, which college students get to have.
