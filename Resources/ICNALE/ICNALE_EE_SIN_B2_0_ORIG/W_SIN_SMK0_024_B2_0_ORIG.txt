As a non-smoker, it would be easy for me to advocate the banning of smoking across all restaurants in the country. However, I do believe that we have to take into account the interests of smokers to a certain degree. The primary issue at stake is second-hand smoke, which is a problem that arises when smoking is permitted in a place that non-smokers do frequent. Research has shown that second-hand smoke can be even more harmful to the body than first-hand smoke, and this can definitely be seen as an unfair negative externality that third parties have to endure. Health is a concern for every individual, and allowing others to compromise this is immensely undesirable. Yet, smokers do exist in every community. In their defence, there are smokers who have tried hard to quit the habit, but have simply grown too reliant. Although this "vice" may not be easy for everyone to "forgive", we have to recognise that these people, too, have interests that they seek to maximise. How, then, can we cater to the interests of both parties? I believe that it is possible to come to a degree of compromise. I propose that instead of implementing a blanket ban on smoking across all restaurants, smoking areas can be introduced. Care must be taken, however, to separate these areas sufficiently (perhaps by glass panels or the like) such that the smoke does not permeate non-smoking areas. The restaurants, then, will also lose neither their smoking customers nor their non-smoking patrons. In this way, we can maximise the benefits to all stakeholders in question.
