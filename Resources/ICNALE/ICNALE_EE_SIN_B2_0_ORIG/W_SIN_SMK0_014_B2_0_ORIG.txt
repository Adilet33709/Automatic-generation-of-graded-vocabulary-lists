I agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country. The harmful side effects of smoking not only affect the smokers, but the second-hand smokers as well. Second-hand smokers are the people who inhale the smoke that the smokers exhale from their body. It is not only harmful, but even more fatal than the smoke inhaled from a cigarette. In a restaurant where there are many patrons enjoying a meal, many of them are non-smokers who dislike the cigarette smell. It is unpleasant to inhale the smoke that not only damages the body, but is also the result of another person's careless behaviour. It is polite for the smokers to leave the restaurant and smoke at a designated place because it shows consideration and basic courtesy. I firmly believe that non-smokers have the rights to stay within premises that are free from cigarette smoke. While smokers have the rights to choose to smoke, it should not be at the expense of innocent non-smokers who have chosen not to smoke. By allowing smoking within restaurants, non-smokers are at the mercy of the fatal second-hand smoke. By exercising this right, customers can have their meals in an environment that do not harm them in any way. Just like how hygiene is of utmost importance during food preparation due to health concerns, smoking is comparable to the effects of food poisoning, if not more severe. To conclude, the long-term side effects of smoking would harm people and outweigh any costs of implementing a no-smoking policy countrywide. In order to effectively implement the no-smoking policy, all restaurants should participate and enforce the policy strictly. This would positively contribute to the efforts to reduce the nicotine addiction worldwide.
