I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking is bad for health, not just for the smoker but also the people around them. At restaurants, diners have their rights to fully enjoy their dining experience. If smoking is not completely banned, many diners will either have to suffer in silence and be engulfed in the smoke or to choose alternative place to dine in. The reason for it being completely banned and not partially or fully unbanned is simple. Smoke can diffuse easily in air which can spread to a much further location from the point where the smoker is. The foul smoke from the smoker can easily affect many tables around him. Even with demarcation for smokers to be there, the smoke does not restrict itself from spreading to non demarcated areas. Thus, other non smoking diners will still be able to smell the smoke. Another reason for banning smoking is that it encourages smokers to quit smoking. With lesser place to smoke in, it will make smoking more inconvenient and can have a positive effect on smokers. Some may argue that smokers have their right to do what they want but if this right infringes on others who have the right to have fresh air, the smokers should just give in. It is also inconsiderate for smokers to pollute the air, especially if the restaurant is air-conditioned which make the dissipation of the foul smell very much slower. Therefore, with the above reasons, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country.
