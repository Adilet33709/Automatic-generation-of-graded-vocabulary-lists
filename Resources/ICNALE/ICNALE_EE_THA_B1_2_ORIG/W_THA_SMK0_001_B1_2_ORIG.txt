In my opinion, to smoke is absolutely bad thing to do. For me, members in my family have no one who is a smoking guy. My father always tells us that it's bad and I really trust him. Do you think that drugs are good? Of course not. For something such as tea or coffee which are drugs too, they don't destroy our health as much as to have a smoke such as smoking. I don't think that it's a good idea. Some people say that while they are relax, their bodies are destroying by the thing that they think it's good for them. I think if somebody is serious, exercising might help them more than smoking, do you think that so? For the easy example, if you are very hungry. There are a poison apple and ingredients of apple pie in front of you, what would you choose? The clever guys will choose ingredients of apple pie, right? Although it might take time for baking a pie and you want to eat and apple, right? But you know that if you eat a poison apple, you will die after you full. So you must choose the slower but better one. Also exercising or playing sports and smoking. The stupid guys always choose the faster one. They don't care results, they know just they are very hungry and they want to eat an apple right now. Trust me, in the future, they will feel sorry about the thing they've done. Lastly, I know that everybody has they own rights, I can't forbid anyone to smoking. But hopefully, I wish they would know some day that a poison apple is not good for them and there are money people who love them and don't want them to destroy themselves.
