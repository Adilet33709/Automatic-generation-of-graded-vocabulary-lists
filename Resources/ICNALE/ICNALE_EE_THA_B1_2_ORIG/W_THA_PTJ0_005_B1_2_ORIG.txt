It is important for college students to have a part-time job. Nowadays many college students have a part-time job. Some students did it for keep their experience, make money or for fun. But I think part-time job not good for all college students, it good for some students only. Because if college students did a part-time job they will have effect on their study and they don't have time to read or practice their learning. For some students can not arrange their time and have a bad grade, they should not did a part-time job. But if they want to do it they will wait for a good time, for example summer, holiday or their free time. Because they should keep time for study and read book. Moreover part-time job is have a good point also. It is students can make money by themselves. And they can help their parent about income and save money of family. When they need something they can buy it buy themselves don't have to disturb their parent. Whatever part-time job is not important for college students because students must be learn and grow up follow by their age. Job will make students grow over age. And if college students have problem about money for study they can request scholarship. Today have a many scholarship for poor students and good students. I think scholarship is better than college students did a part-time job.
