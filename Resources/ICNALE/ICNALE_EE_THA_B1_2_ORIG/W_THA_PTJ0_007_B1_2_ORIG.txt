I agree because, first part time job make you spend your free time in the right way. Somebody kill their time by go shopping or traveling all of activity lose your time but if you get the job in the shop or restaurant. That's earning your money. Second it can improve your skill if you only meet the small social and have no accommodate so the job would help you to meet new many kinds of people that's might be good for you. Third it's improved your patient and can make you grow up; the job sometime might be hard or not comfortable; if you can pass it that would be great. Fourth you are in the college that's mean you are not the little child. The part time job can help you parent and you would be proud to your self that you can earn your pocket money by your two hands but in other word your mother would not reprove you any more about your new shirt or new shoes. And the last reason some learner have not much time to have an exercise so do the job would help you to move your body and use your brain the result is your health is good. I think it is the good way to spend your time on past time job and don't forget to study hard too.
