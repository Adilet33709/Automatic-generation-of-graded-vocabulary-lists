In the recent day Thai people become smoker more than in the past so there are polluted atmosphere in everywhere. That is the worst specimen for traditional teenager. Smoking is the cause of cancer and makes the harm to the smoker and closed-people around them. There are many disadvantages about smoke the cigarettes for example bad smell, black teeth and gum, and addicted. In my opinion smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. Not only the entire restaurant but also school, hospital, park, or the public place. Although in my opinion is the best way that I think to make a good condition and save smokers' health and the others around them for having a meal in restaurant but it is so badly about the smokers. So we should have some area or place for smoking as the smoking area in the airport. Because of all people are not smokers. If I think about the owner of the restaurants should declare about area for smoking or specific for type of your restaurants to your customers. I think smoking is bad for you and your loved-family. No smoking is best thing to do. For the smoker when you want to smoke might think about the others around yourself and keep your manner so anyone can not argue on you.
