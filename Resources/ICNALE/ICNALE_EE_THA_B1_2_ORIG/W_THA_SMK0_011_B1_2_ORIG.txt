Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. ??? In my opinion, I believe that smoking should be completely banned. Not only is smoking any form of tobacco dangerous to you health, but it is also bad for the health of those around you. Smoking should be banned at the restaurants and for all public areas. Smoking negatively affects our society through environmental problems, economic problems, health risks to others, and especially health problems it cause within children. There is no reason to smoke cigarettes and doing so does not benefit anyone in any way. Smoking in public is the same as driving drunk because both endanger the lives of innocent people who choose not to engage in the reckless behavior. The only difference is that with smoking the affects are not visible immediately because it has long term affects. Banning smoking in public will ultimately increase the quality of life and in turn will better society as a whole. At last I agree that completely smoke-free places are the ideal, and some businesses have taken the decision to go completely smoke-free. However, everyone agrees that, it is a matter of rights - the right of smokers to smoke versus non-smokers to protect from passive smoking and to breathe clean air.
