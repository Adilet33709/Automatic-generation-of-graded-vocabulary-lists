Smoking causing harmful to themselves but also harm those whom staying around you. Smoking release many toxins and it also cause cancer. People may face many smokers who smoke in public places. However, for us, to smoke in restaurants, it's not to be made in a very much. Because the restaurant offers many services to people both young and elderly adults who don't smoke. They separate smoking areas and non smoking areas. For anyone who wants to smoke, they will respect the rules by going outside so people sitting in the restaurant don't get any smell from the cigarettes. Restaurants are for having fun and relaxing, it doesn't need to banned the smokers. In coffee shops, many people love drinking coffee with smoking. I think it's personal taste so if we still produce and sell cigarettes, why do we have to banned them? To bane the smoking is not the solutions, if people don't wanna see anyone to smoke, we should stop producing and selling. Smoking should not be banned but just having two different areas for customers, for smokers and for non smokers. Thus, everyone is happy cuz each side has their own pace. Smokers got their place to smoke, non smokers got their place to enjoy eating, the owner of the restaurants is happy because they don't lose any customers.
