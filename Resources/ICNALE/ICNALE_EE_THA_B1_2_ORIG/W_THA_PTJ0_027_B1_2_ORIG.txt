In college, there are lots of students talk, think and work on part-time job. There are many kind of work that college students like to work on such as waiter, waitress, cashier and etc. Do you think it is necessary for college students? If you ask me about have a part-time job when you study in college. I can think of both side good and bad things. If you talk about the family that not rich enough for spend the money on study in college, I think working on part-time is important. When you study in college, you can only just learn and learn but if you don't have enough money for eat, live, or buy a book. You must have a part-time job for this thing. In other way, if you have enough money for everything. I think part-time job is unnecessary for you because when you work on part-time job. You will not have much time for rest, read a book or work on your homework. If you want to work on part-time job, you must manage your time for everything you have to do first. If you have much free time, you can work on part-time job. When you manage everything clearly, I think part-time will give you more experience on working and you will have more money for shopping.
