Now I am studying at Mae Fah Luang University, Chiang Rai, Thailand. I am studying in school of liberal arts English major. I agree with part time job. Part time job can make teenagers increase responsibility, develop their own personalities. Teenagers who work part time job can practice to be careful when they meet many kind people and they will know benefit of money, how hard to earn it. I agree with a part time job. The first reason is part time job can help teenagers preparing life to adult that must have more responsibility. When teenagers take a part time job must have responsibility to manage time for study, relax, work, and travel. Second the young can learn how to life with other people, ad just the unfamiliar environment. Third teenagers learn what that she or he want to be in the future. They can plan what they have to learn that useful for their future job. Finally, teenager will know benefit or money, how hard to earn it, I think that no one wants to waste the money that they have to exchange by their effort. In conclusion, part time job is the good idea to prepare the young change to adult. I hope that the schools or universities and parents will support young people to work part time job.
