One day, you go to the restaurant. You order food for you meal. After that the waiter serves your food on the table. After you eat for a while, you smell about something bad. It is smoking smell. How will you feel about it? When you have a meal in the restaurant, if you smell of bad thing, you will feel very disfavor of it. So I think smoking smell is one of bad smell that need to completely banned in restaurant because when someone have smoking, they smoking smell will annoy everybody around them and it also cause lung cancer to everybody. It must have a force law about smoking in restaurant such as penalty if you smoke in restaurant area or sent them to jail. There is other way to fix smoking in restaurant area problem. If the restaurant allows smoking in restaurant area, you must have a special room for smoking. So they smell will not annoy everybody anymore. There are lots of ways to fix the smoking in restaurant problem but I think the best way to fix this problem is teach a good moral to the baby and tell to smoking is bad thing or government must create new law about banned smoking, not just in restaurant but everywhere. That will make their country better.
