At the present, a lot of people died because of smoking and still have some people who risk to get a cancer. I agree with this statement that we should banned smoking in restaurants. In my opinion, nowadays smoking is seemed to be normal for the most people. They like to smoke in everywhere. Restaurant is a place where family likes to have dinner or have a nice time together or some people use it for meeting. So, this place has different ages such as children, teenager, adult and old people. If someone has smoking in restaurant, it could effected with people who surround smoker, imagine that how many people surround him will be a second smoker and it also effected on themselves. An atmosphere also was destroyed. And I think it not fair that they didn't smoke but why they had to get that bad effect from someone who they don't know. We should do something to protect people from this effect and I agree with this way and think that it will be better if all the restaurants have a rule that not allow smoking in there. And when they start to use it, I think it will be a point that attracts people to come in.
