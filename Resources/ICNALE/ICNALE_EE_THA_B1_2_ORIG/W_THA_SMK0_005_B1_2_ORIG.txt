Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I agree with this topic smoking at all the restaurants should be banned. And public place should be banned too. For example : at park, bus stop, university, hotel and etc. because smoking make many problems to population. The restaurants have a many people. Smoke is smelly, when smoker is smoking at restaurants it make a disturb with others people. And it is become air-pollution. Smoker should not smoking at restaurants or public place. No one like smoke so that smoker must be have manner with others people. Some restaurants or public place have a smoking place, smoker must smoking at this place. People can banned smoker who don't have manner because smoke can make the lungs cancer smoker should take care others people. Moreover smoking can make danger at restaurants. Because at restaurants have many gases, when smoker is smoking a sparks fire can make danger. Ban can decrease smoker because smoker can not smoking at public place. It make them feel hard to smoking. If people not banned bad smoker in the future smoking may be increase. And it can become to be a simple behavior of smoker. So, if smoker don't have manner another people should be completely banned them.
