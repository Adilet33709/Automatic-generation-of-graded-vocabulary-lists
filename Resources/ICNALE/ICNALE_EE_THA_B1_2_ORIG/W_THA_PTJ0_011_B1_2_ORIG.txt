It is important for college students to have a part-time job. ??? I agree about It is important for college students to have a part-time job. because some time they have more free time that can spend to do part time job. Not only spend free time in good way but it is one preparation to get into adult life such as dealing with many strange people, develop personalities and learning how to take responsibility for what you have done. part time job can train they how to earn money and let we know that it is not an easy thing to make money. Then they will use their money more and more carefully. Besides, I think that being a college student, if we want to buy something we really want, we should earn money by ourselves, not using the money of our parents. Using our own money, we will not feel guilty anymore. Or if the kids can give the parents the money that is earned by them, their parents will be very happy. At last In my opinion part time job is a good for student who have more free time but it should not affect our study.
