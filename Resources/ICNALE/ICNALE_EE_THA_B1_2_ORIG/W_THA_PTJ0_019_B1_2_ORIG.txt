In the presents, most of people who do the part-time job not always are worker but can be someone who not graduated yet, often be high school student or college student. In my opinion, I think it has two ways to think of it that it is important or not for college students to have a part-time job. First, I think that the college students should intend to study. Second, if we see in another side, we will see that a part-time job is good for some students, who have less money. Nowadays, In college, they usually finish class early and they don't have to study all day as students in high school, so it is easy if they want to get a part-time job and I think it was a good idea that college students should have part-time job because they could get a lesson from outside of classroom which is sometime better than they just sit and study in the school or college and they could get a life experience also. Last, I think part-time job might be teach them a lot of thing for example: it can help us to manage a time in daily life, train themselves to have a responsibility, always be on time, spend free time for usefully, help their expenses, learn how to use and keep money and the last is thinking process, how to fix a facing problem.
