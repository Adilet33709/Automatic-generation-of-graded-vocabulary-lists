In my opinion, to get part-time job to do in daily life is a good choice. Some of student in universities want money for educating. Most of these students don't have enough money for learning, so part-time jobs help them waste less money. Some of students want money for buying something they want. That's a good thing because it's mean they don't use their parent's money for something they prefer and that things will meant for them. From the part, I can see that part-time jobs have many benefits. But in the other hands, there aren't all kind of part-time jobs are good. There are also jobs that dangerous for students, especially, for girls. For example, some of girls are waitress in pubs. Of course, it's very dangerous for the innocent girls. But these kinds of job can give them much money and faster. Even though you work in restaurant, if you have bad friends, there are terrible things waiting for you too. So many parents won't let their children do part-time jobs. But I think that anything has their own pros. and cons., so it's up to any person for choosing their own lives. The most important thing, everybody should have their own right thoughts. Do anything you think that it's the best way. But don't forget to ask your parents and trust them because they exactly know the best thing for you.
