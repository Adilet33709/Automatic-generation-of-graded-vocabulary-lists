As for me, I am a smoker as well. One smokes for different reasons. Teenager smokes for fun. Doctor may smoke for doing surgery with great pressure. Soldier smokes because days are boring. Smoking may be bad for smokers and even worse for non-smokers. There are ways to prevent this kind of thing, or it would be unfair for those smokers. Government can divide all the restaurants into two parts: one is for smokers; the other is for non-smokers. In this way, there is a solution to resolve the problem. If one day, government do really put it into practice, this may somehow become unreasonable. If one day smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants, slowly and slowly, we may start to regulate other place stop smoking, from school to hospital.... etc. But we have to know that smoking do have its value to exist. Without smoking, this world can't work in good situation. We should never eliminate anything at random without neglect its result. Smoke may even has its remedy to cure patients. Some people may live on it to earn money. This could not be banned too much, because this can be a habit, and it can even be a fashion among those great people.
