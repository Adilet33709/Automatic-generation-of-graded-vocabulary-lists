In the country, it is not that everyone likes smoking. Due to this problem, a lot of managers set the smoking corner in their own restaurant. We can know that smoking is not just a hurtful behavior for our health, however, why those managers do not just ban the behavior in their restaurants? First, I think that it is because smoking has become a habit. Moreover, it is not illegal. So, if smoking was banned, it will cause big troubles. Second, the restaurant is a important social place when people discuss or chat with each other, etc. If someone's habit is banned in the restaurant, he or she must be more passive to go to the restaurant than before. Thus, it will take damages on business possibly if managers directly ban smoking in restaurants. Therefore, it is difficult for us to ban smoking in restaurants in the country. We can sustain smokers to depress their number of smoking, but we can not just ban it. Of course, the ways of that set new smoking corner or upgrade it become the major cure for the smoking hurting. If it is useful to prevent smoking hurting, then we have not to deal with this problem with a too severe heart.
