I agree that it's important for college students to have a part-time job. I'm a college student and I have a part-time job. Because my family financial situation is not well, I should make some money to pay my school expenses. Except making money, I got something else from working at part-time. First, I got the ability of dealing with different problems, because I had to face different customers who had different asks. Second, the more working experience you have the easier you get a job in the future. In my process of finding jobs, most bosses don't like to hire employees who have no experience. In my viewpoint, accumulating the working experience as possible as you can is good for you in the future. Different jobs can let you learn something that not be taught at school. Even there are so many advantages for having part-time job, students shouldn't be affected the school life by the part-time job. We should make the perfect balance between part-time jobs and school life. Giving consideration to these two things makes your college life colorful. After all, it's a good experience for you and you will learn much things form your job. Part-time job is important to me, to you. So, to find one and start new life.
