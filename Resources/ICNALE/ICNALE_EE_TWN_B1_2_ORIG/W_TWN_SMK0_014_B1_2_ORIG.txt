I definitely agree with it. In fact, although it is hard to achieve, I hope that smoking can be completely banned at all public spaces someday. Although some people think smoking make them feel comfort and relax, the truth is, cigarettes still do hardly anything good but harm our health. And the most important of all, people should have the right to refuse to breathe in the second-hand smoke. Restaurants are public spaces, people want to smoke should consider the others who might not please to dine in the circumstance full of smoke. After all, if the whole restaurant is full of smoke, how do you enjoy the smell of food and taste it in good mood? People who have the habit of smoking should knowing that not everyone can stand the smell of it, in fact, the smell of smoking is terrible for some people who do not smoke at all. Moreover, it is obvious that smoke or breathe in the second-hand smoke harm our health. Thus, the next time you step in a restaurant, even you don't care about your lung; please respect the right for others in the same restaurant who might not will to breathe in second-hand smoke.
