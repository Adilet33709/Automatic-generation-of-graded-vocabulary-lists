Smoking is harmful to everybody. Those who like to smoke will hurt their families, friends and someone surrounding them, because secondhand smoke contains a lot of toxic chemicals, they would cause lung cancer and heart disease. But those who like to smoke are difficult to quit the bad habit. When they smoke in a public place, the people around them would feel uncomfortable, smoking affects their health. The government has smoking completely banned in all public places. 90% of people support it, but smokers say that the law would deprive their rights. Its a really difficult problem. Maybe smokers could think over quitting smoking, it would be salutary to themselves and their families or friends. I am not a smoker, and I think, it is essential that smoking should be completely banned in public. The law prevents others from secondhand smoke's harm. The amount of fumes others smell and breathe in from smokers is really annoying. Ban smoking in public places doesn't deprive smokers' rights. On the other side, it protects others' right. Smokers will still have the right to smoke in their private space. And non-smokers will be free to smoke in public place. Isn't it a wonderful law?
