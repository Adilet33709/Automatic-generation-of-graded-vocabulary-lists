Having a part-time job is important for college student. In my opinion, there are several benefits from the part-time job experience. First, without a doubt, the spending such as the money for food, grocery, pleasure and so on, all that from college students is a large number. Therefore, taking part-time job can not only release the economical pressure to family but also make students take the responsibility for them. Second, many forth-grade students who are about to graduate worry their future for jobs, therefore, taking part-time jobs before graduation helps students collect social experience and have chance to close to every work of life. Through this way, college students are more likely to find out their true interest in fields of works, this may explain the reason why many students after graduation are not in the relevant fields they learned in campus. Otherwise, part-time jobs offer another learning opportunity for students. Don't look down on any job; every job is filled with knowledge and values. Take servants for example, if students have jobs in restaurants, they should learn how to deal with many unexpected problems, including keeping smile and patience while blamed by boss or costumers. As time goes by, students would become more mature and good at solving problems wisely. Are you a college student? Do you have a part-time job? If not, why not find a part-time job right now?
