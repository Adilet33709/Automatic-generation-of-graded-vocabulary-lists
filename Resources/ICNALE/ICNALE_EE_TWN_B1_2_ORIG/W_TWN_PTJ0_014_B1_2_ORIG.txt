I think it is good but necessary for college students to have a part-time job. It is good to have some working experiments in school. More working experiments might help you have more chance than the other to get the job you want after you leaving school. This means, it may bring you more competitive capacity than others. And you can also learn how to get along with people, and understand the difficulty of earning money. It may make you more mature. But in the other way, as we may spend almost whole the rest of our life to seek and work hard for money, I don't think it is necessary for us to start it in our school life. People always want to be adults in their childhood; and want to be students when they started working. There are many things we can do only in school. Unless there are economy problems, I don't think the time the part-time job cost is worthy. Moreover, for those who cannot arrange their time well, it is possible to spend too much time and energy on the part-time job, which cause they overpass their school grades. Thus, if there are no reasons, enjoy your college life. Don't be too eager to step in your business life, or you may regret with it.
