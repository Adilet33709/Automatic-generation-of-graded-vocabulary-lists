In my opinion, I think it's important for college students to have a part-time job. Why? I have two reasons. First, a part-time job can increase our experience, and you could learn many things that don't teach in the class. For example, if you work in a restaurant, you could learn how to communicate with different people, and you also could learn how to handle emergency condition. If you are a home-teacher, you could increase your patience and you will know it's not easy to be a good teacher, maybe you will study more hard in the class. Also, you can make different kinds of people in different job, than you could learn more from their experience. Second, a part-time job can earn money, than you can share the economic press with your parents. Maybe the money is not much, but the feeling of earning money by yourself is so good. Finally, I suggest college students should find a part-time job. Maybe the job you do has no relation with what you study now, but it's a good way to try different things. It will make your college life more colorful. And it really has a lot beneficial in your future career life.
