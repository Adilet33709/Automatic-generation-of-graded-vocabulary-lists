Part-time jobs are important to college students. College students have too many social activities, like the clubs, parties and some competitions. They want to make more friends and experience the different life. So, they spend more. Because they spend more, they need some extra money in their pocket. So, some college students will find part-time jobs or be a tutor. If the working-hour is too long, sometimes, those college students may delay their studies, but they are usually shortsighted. They think that earning money is much more important than studying well. They waste their time on part-time jobs and join too many activities. As a result, some people suspend their schooling to get more part-time jobs. When they grow older, they would regret their decision, it is just like to put the cart before the horse. They give up their studies, for that meager salary. That's really ridiculous. As I am concerned, maybe I would get a part-time job when I have much free time, like the summer vacation or the winter vacation, or I can pass the study course easily. The most important thing is to complete the course you should study. Then, after you graduate, you will find a better job.
