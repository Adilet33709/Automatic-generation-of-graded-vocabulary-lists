It is necessary that college students have a part-time job. The major purpose of college is education, thus, the college must provide a safe environment and a peaceful learning place. Because of the safe environment at school, students are always protected from the ruthless social reality about the work, so they can not observe that what differences do it has when students are in workplace and educational place. Students can get skills which are important in work attitude in workplace and increase their patience in order to deal with troubles, also they will be understand how to find out the relation between the part-time job and all the knowledge they learnt in their college. Most of all, a part-time job for college students can make them actively get friends and expand their eyesight, so they will not set their target too small and narrow in future. In all effects that college students have a part-time job, I guess the most important and deepest one is about work attitude and patience. Even someone is smart or learned, he or she will easily be in troubles if he or she lacks any one of the above. Frankly speaking, the learning of getting alone with people will always be important and difficult than the learning of knowledge. We can compare workplace with the new college that proffers learning of human relations. From a part-time job, we can learn more skills about how to live well in workplace.
