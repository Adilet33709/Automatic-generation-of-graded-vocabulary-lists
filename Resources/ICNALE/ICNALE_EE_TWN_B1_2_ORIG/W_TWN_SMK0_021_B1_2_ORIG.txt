I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking is like a drug. It makes people become addicted. Most people know that smoking is bad for their health, but many persons still don't stop smoking. Doctors always warn us that smoking will make cancer heart problems and lung diseases. Another problem is that smoking will create smoke, and the smoke from the cigarettes will pollute the air. This smoke will cause a bad smell, and make people feel uncomfortable. Thus, the smoke will produce the problem called "second-hand smoke". Second-hand smoking, smoke took by people near a smoker, will make other people who don't smoke feel bad and can cause the same illnesses as smoking. So second-hand smoking hurts other people, along with the smoker. It's time for all governments in the world to ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country. If you want to enjoy your delicious dinner, you won't to smell the smoke. No smoking restaurants will be a tendency when more and more persons pay attention to everything healthy. Thus, there is no reason why this "drug" should be legal. The governments should raise the wine and tobacco tax to lower the number of buying cigarettes persons. To achieve the goal that no-smoking environment for all the people.
