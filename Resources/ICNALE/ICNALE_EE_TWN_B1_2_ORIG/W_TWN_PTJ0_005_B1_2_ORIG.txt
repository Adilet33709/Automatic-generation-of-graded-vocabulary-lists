In my opinion, it is necessary for college students to have part-time job once their school grade or other condition become steady. Why? First, college students are old enough to be financially dependent. They are no more kids, and they have the responsibility to lessen the pressure from their parent. They have to understand how hard is working, thus, they can save and never waste their money. Second, they are no more students in a few years, so they have to judge what kind of job suit them through taking part-time jobs. Take me as an example. As a male, although I have to do the military responsibility first, and after one year then I have to work. I am very afraid now. Many of my classmates are worried about finding no job, and I may face the same situation after one year. One of my classmates declined a chance to be a teacher in the kindergarten, because she found herself having no interest in education. And some of my classmates felt sad and worried after the interview of a job, because they found themselves having no the skills or experiences that the boss wanted. So I think it's good to test college students' ability by having part-time job.
