I think it is a good regulation that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Of course, there are pros and cons for smoking. However, there is only one advantage comes into my mind. People who smoke will trigger chemical reaction in their brain which makes them feel good, happy, and comfortable, but they will have to get more cigarettes to achieve the same level of happiness. Thus, the first disadvantage is that people will gradually spend more money on smoking. Second, the most serious problem resulted from smoking is health damage. Smoking destroys people's lungs. Smokers can't breathe as well as normal ones. They can't be good athletes. Health issues may influence their life qualities, too. Besides, smoking increase the risk of suffering from cancer. What's worse, smoking has great impact on both smokers and people around those smokers. That's the main reason I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. When someone smokes in a restaurant, it does not only influence others at that time but also people who come in the future. Because those furniture and walls may absorb the bad things come from the cigarettes, and then impact future customers. Thus, I think smoking ought to be prohibited at all the restaurants in the country.
