Smoking will also addictive, but I rarely around people who smoke. So I think smoking will affect one another. I often read the news reports, how many people in Taiwan a year because of smoking suffering from illness or even death, and the adverse effects of secondhand smoke far more than people imagine, but the law has no way to establish clear and effective laws and regulations. After all, this is a personal habit so the implementation of the law can not do. So I think the school Education is important, clearly let people know smoking is the kind of bad habit. In addition to other personal health problems, smoking will bring very bad effect on the environment. When I see a smoker on the road when they will not take away cigarette butts, but he readily threw in the street. I think this is very good. This habit will cause environmental mess, and the destruction of the beauty of the road. I think this is very good. This habit will cause environmental mess, and the destruction of the beauty of the road. So I hope people can think about what smoking can be good for you. If the answer is no, then please stop this behavior, or the persuade smokers around you. Life must not smoke more beautiful.
