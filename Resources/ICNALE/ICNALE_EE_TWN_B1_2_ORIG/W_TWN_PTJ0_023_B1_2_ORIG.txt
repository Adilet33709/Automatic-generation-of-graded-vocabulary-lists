I agree with the opinion that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are many reasons that I think working part-time is a good idea. The first advantage comes into my mind is that students can earn money for their allowance by their own. They are not their families' burden anymore. Some outstanding students can even be financially independent. Second, people who earn money by themselves will not spend money because they want to but because they need to. Since they earn every penny by their own, they understand the value of money and learn to cherish it. Besides, in order to maintain normal school performance, it is meaningful for college students to learn how to manage their time well. Time management is vital at all time. What's more, they may have trouble with their co-workers, employers or customers. When dealing with problems, they understand the worth of cooperation and identify their responsibilities. However, some people may still disagree that college students have part-time jobs. They think all students have to do is focus on their academic works. Having part-time jobs will not bring positive influence on their school performances. But as I have explained before, it is not always true. Although school performance is important, it doesn't mean everything. Also, part-time jobs can teach students something that they can't learn in school. I think students who have part-time jobs acquire more benefits than those who don't.
