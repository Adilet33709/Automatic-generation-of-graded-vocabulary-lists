Smoking is a bad habit, but it shouldn't be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Many people may question and doubt why, but the reason is obvious. Of course smoking is harmful for health, and it would also affect others' health, however, if we advocate no smoking in all the restaurants in country, does anybody think of the chain-smokers? Chain smokers have made it a rule to smoke, it's so hard to ask them quit smoking habit in short time. So, if all the restaurants ban the smoking, it may result in a wave of anger. Besides, the measure seems so extreme that many smokers may choose not to eat out. What will happen at last? Some restaurants are likely to break the rules to attract customers and make money. In my opinion, restaurants should set up a smoking place or smoking rooms instead of banning smoking, the action doesn't encourage people to smoke, it just offer some room for smokers to relax temporally. A chain-smoker will be unhappy without smoking, and who wants to see somebody having a long face when enjoying meal at restaurants? In conclusion, setting up smoking places is better than banning smoking at all restaurants, the former may be a better policy and be reciprocal for all the restaurants, costumers and smokers.
