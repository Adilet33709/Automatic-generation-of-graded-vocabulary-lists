In my opinion, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. And the rule should be done strict rigidly. Why? First, the cigarette is harmed to our body. According to the report, smoking person has the more chance to get cancer and other diseases. And, the people who do not smoking but have second-smoking also have the higher chance to damage the lane. And most of the restaurants are indoors, the air is closed and not fresh. And if somebody smoking, all the people in the restaurant may smell it. In my experience, I hate the smell of smoking, every time when I smell the smoking air in the restaurant; I had a bad feeling, than I don't want to eat anymore because the food is also not clean. So I think it's better to have a law about do not smoke in the restaurant. In some restaurants, they have divided into two parts, smoking and not smoking area. But I think it's not a good idea, because we still could smell the bed air. So, in my thinking, I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
