After enter the college, many people will did part-time jobs to earn money. Their main purpose is increasing their pocket money, and I was no exception. I did many part-time jobs for example cram school teacher, restaurant waitress, file management, and giving away the flyers. Even I have experience that writing the news releases, in crossing the investigation. The main purpose of working is making money, but I will take my part-time job seriously, and contribute my enthusiasm. Even if giving away the flyers, I also give amiable mood and smiles to every passerby. When I face my employers, I hold a modest and polite attitude. I always modestly learn and do my best, when I do not understand how to do that. Even I meet the bad customers make the difficult for me, I am not discouraged. After all, this is only part of my work. These part-time job experience let me know that how difficult in the work, and I will be more cautious for the use of money. I believe that even if I do not need too much out of fear of society. After all, I have had many similar experiences that can not learning in the school.
