Cigarettes made from tobacco grown almost everywhere in the world and all countries almost every government around the world grant factory to produce cigarettes for sale to people. A lot of profits both government and enterprise earned each year. However, WHO knows the danger of cigarettes for smokers and non-smoker will be equal or even worse for their health. Smoking can causes cancer and many other symptoms. Smokings in public places such as public parks, bus stops or in the street which are in the open areas cause danger to health of people not only smokers but also non-smokers who are in the areas. If smokers smoke in the closed area such as in the theater, in the house, in the restaurant, in the air plane etc. can cause more danger because everyone both smokers and non-smokers will easily harmful by smoke. The restaurants are the place where people come to enjoy their foods and drinks mostly with their families if smoker come to sit together in the same restaurants and start to smoke can ruin the atmosphere in the restaurants and also cause danger to health of all people around them. The air-condition restaurants even worse when smokers start smoking their cigarettes because there is no air ventilate to get rid of all smoke but it will be in their breath and to all lungs of people. Government, especially ministry of public health which is realize health of people should issue law against smoking in the restaurants both non air-condition and air-condition one to keep people away from smoke of cigarettes. I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banded at all restaurants in the country.
