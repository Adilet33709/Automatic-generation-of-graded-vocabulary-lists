It is important for college students to have a part-time job? Are you one of the students who have a part-time job? What do you think about it? Nowadays, there are a lot of college students who have a part-time job. Some people question it's important for students?. In my opinion it has three major benefits of college students have a part-time job are work experience, save parent's money, use free time to useful. First, part-time job is a way to Internship. This is important factor because in the future, when they graduate the students must have work. If they had a part-time job before, they would have done better than others because they have experience more than others. Experience is one of the most important factors that necessary in a person's life. Saving parent's money is the second benefit of part-time job. With the money that they get on part-time job, students don't have to use parent's money. They can help their parents reduce expenses and they can save money to use in the future. Third, nowadays most of students use free time to play game and internet, listen music or etc that useless but if they had a part-time job, they will use free time to useful. In conclusion, part-time job has three benefits. It trains students for work in the future. The student can save theirs parent's money because they have an income and they will change theirs useless free time to useful. If Thai students can do these, how many benefit that Thailand will get?
