The restaurants are the public places for people. Because it has many people go to that place, like child, elderly. Eating is good, if we know to choose everything for myself. So, that has many factors. It is atmosphere, cleaning, savor, procedure, price, place, etc. And eating is bad. It many factors too, like smoking. It is a important cause of everything. I think about smoking in the restaurant. Smoking, it is bad for your health and the other people, like bad mouthed, bad tooth, get pollutant, bad looking. Addition, it is a cause of the bad atmosphere and the area has dirty. Eating is so bad too. So, should to ban smoking in the restaurant because it has many bad results for health, atmosphere and eating. This is not something far from us, it concerns our living and very close to. You may think that you have no right to do this but actually you can do. if you start from yourself not smoke in public places and restaurants, then you tell your member in your family not hurt people by smoking and make smell around those places, then tell or warn your friends or any others to not smoke in any place that can hurt others, the smoking can be stopped or reduced. See that, it's easy to do if you start from yourself and expand to other around you.
