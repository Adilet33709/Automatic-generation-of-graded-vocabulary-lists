Thailand is my country and smoking is the big problem in my country there are a lot of people died because they smoking too much and someone died because they breath among the people who often smoking without cares of others. The place that have a lot of people and difference habits is in the restaurants. I have ever enter to the restaurant and next to me there is a man that he is smoking and the smoke is around that area I am so suffocated because I don't like that smell so I am very agree if the restaurants in my country banned smoking. Moreover it is very good that the restaurants don't have someone who would like to smoking but they can because it save good atmosphere and pure breath for another. Banned smoking in the restaurants is not enough for decrease the smoking problem because if someone that addicted in smoking they still have a lot of place to do but banned smoking in the restaurants are a little bit part that we can help the person who want to smoking and in the short time but it is very good if we can ban smoking in everywhere for make our country to be a country without the smoking.
