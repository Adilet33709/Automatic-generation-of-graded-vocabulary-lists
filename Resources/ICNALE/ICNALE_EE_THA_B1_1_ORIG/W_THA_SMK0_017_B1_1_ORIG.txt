I think smoking in the public place is a bad manner of many people because it makes many people around that area not comfortable to breath. I really do agree with this topic because it should be that smoking is a bad manner in my opinion, because it think it doesn't make any advantages for anyone while it still makes affect to anyone such as, children, women, pregnant and everybody that doesn't like it. In cause of smoking in the restaurant, I think it is a big cause. Why is that, because the restaurants are the places for eating, partying, or have some special times to do a good memorial. Therefore, it really shouldn't have smoking in this place. But if some restaurant doesn't need to ban smoking, I think a good way to solve that is the manager of restaurant should provide a special area to smoke. However, smoker should be having awareness also. They can go out the restaurant to smoke, because it will not make problem to everybody in restaurant. Don't forget that smoking doesn't makes well for everyone, while it makes the bad things for many people. Therefore, I do really agree with the topic and I do support if the restaurants will bane smoking in the area
