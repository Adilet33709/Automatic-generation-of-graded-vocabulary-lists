In the college, there are many activities to do such as learning subjects, doing researches, making appointments, testing quizzes, reading papers, etc. The college student should do activities in the college because they will be helped the student can learn, play and work together appropriately. Some department of the student college is hard to pass graduated and get good grades. Because the student may spend many time or share time in period. That is not the college period such as weekend, holiday, long holiday, Sunday, etc. They might divide time properly and use time co together with the other such as friends, teacher, place, etc, In my opinion, having a part-time in Thailand is not important for every college students. The student should do main tasks and there are many activities before more than have a part-time job in student lifestyle. If you have the certainly free-time, you may do a part-time job. I think just only do activities of the student department and college, it is enough for the college student so It is not necessary for having a part-time job in the college student. Part-time job, it can do every time but tasks and activities in the college may do only once or certainly time. Part-time may make you waste your effective progress in the student college.
