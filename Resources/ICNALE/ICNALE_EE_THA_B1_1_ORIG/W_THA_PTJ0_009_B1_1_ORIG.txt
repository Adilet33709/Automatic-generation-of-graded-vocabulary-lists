In my opinion, I think that take the part time job while be a college student is very important thing to do, because the part time job give a lot of experience and necessary skills that we have to use when we are an employer, labor or boss. The part time job will teach you that what you should do when you are in the part of company and it will teach how to change yourself to be like others. The part time job gives you an important thing that is you must com on time, because time is the important thing for the world of works. If you come to work late, it means you are make a serious problem to your organizations, so time is the important thing and you can not disagree that the part time job is not important for college students because the experience will gain from perform. It's not gain for trading or shop, so the experiences are similar with the boxes golden that you have to find and find it to make your box full, but the box of experiences does not the day of full, experience can increase anytime and anywhere if you want to do. Last the part time job is important for college student. Because it can make you be a perfect man.
