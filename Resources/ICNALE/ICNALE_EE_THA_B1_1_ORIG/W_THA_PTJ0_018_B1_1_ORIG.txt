Why many college students decide to do a part-time job although they can only learning and use their free time to rest. Some student must work a part-time job because of their family credit, while others do a part-time job because they want to. Personally, I think it's important for college students to have a part-time job First of all, the students that have a part-time job can get some money to share the work of their family and they can develop many important skills to become a good worker, such as responsibility, punctuality and self-command. They also learn how to work with other people and gain many experience from older workers. Most importantly, when the college students graduate and want to find a job. The students who had a part-time job in the past are more interesting than the other whom not. Especially, the students that did a lot of past-time jobs for many years, it's a proof of diligence of them. However, there are some students who do a part-time job brush away to learn in campus. They must to memorize that the reason why they are students is to learn to find a good work in the future. In my opinion, I don't think that do a part-time job while learning can make any problems if they use their time worthily. In conclusion, I think that a part-time job is the first step to the key of success.
