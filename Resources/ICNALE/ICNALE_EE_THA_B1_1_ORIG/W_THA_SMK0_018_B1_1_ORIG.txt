Nowadays, our world is much pollution that causes people health fall off every day. Smoking is one of the reasons that causes air pollution without good effect to anything. It also makes a bad atmosphere with it smoke to everywhere it arrives. Especially, when it travels in the restaurant where many people can eat and talk to each other with joyful emotion. From my point of view, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. First of all, smoking is the easiest way to destroy users and people around them. I have no ideas why smokers want to harm themselves. But I think that no one want to stand near the smokers and inhale a lot of pollution to their lung. There are many people died everyday because disease from tobacco's smoke. Another reason is that the restaurants are public places that everyone can come in. There are people who hate smoke from tobacco very much. It extremely impolite to make them irritate and destroy good atmosphere in the restaurant by your smoking. Finally, I strongly believe that no one want to see the smokers in the restaurant. Because they need to dine their meal with happiness and nobody have the right to disturb theirs enjoy.
