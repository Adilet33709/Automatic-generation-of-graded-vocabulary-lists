I extremely agree with this. Don't you think when you are eating happily with your family or your friends then there are some smoke and bad smell came suddenly to your table that is very annoying? I don't understand why do people smoking. Smoking only gives them a lot of bad things, especially about your health. Smoking is cause of many diseases about your lung, throat, mouth, and your heart. If you smoke only one time you will have more risk to have lung cancel and heart disease. Not only a smoker has the risk, but people around the smoker must have the risk too. This is sad that the people who receive smoke from the smoker that call 'two-handed smoker' must have the higher risk than smoker itself! I thing every smoker know the bad thing about smoking and know that he or she will hurt their beloved. Then why do some still smoking? I think we should ban all smoking in public place not only in restaurant. And we must do it strongly legal. If smoking is bad for everybody why do we still keep it in our country? Why we don't erase them? And have a better health.
