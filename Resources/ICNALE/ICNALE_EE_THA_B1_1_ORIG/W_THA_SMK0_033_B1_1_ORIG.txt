Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country? Are you one of the people that smoking at restaurants? Nowadays, there a lot of people complaining that they want to ban smoking at restaurants, what do you think about it? In my opinion, two major benefits of smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country are disturbing others and risk of accidents. First, smoking at the restaurants is disturbing others such as; children, women and pregnant women. Others people at restaurant will be disturbed by smell and smoke from smoking. Smoke from cigarette is contains substances that are harmful to human's body. So, smoking at the restaurants is disturbing others and also harmful to the body. Second, smoking at the restaurants has a risk to be an accident. Smoking can not be without fire and chef at restaurant can not cooking some food without gas, if the smokers lack of caution. It has a chance to be an accident. In conclusion, smoking at the restaurant should be banned by two major benefits. It disturbing others and harmful to the human's body. If Thai people can not stop smoking at the restaurant, what kind of society will Thailand become in the future?
