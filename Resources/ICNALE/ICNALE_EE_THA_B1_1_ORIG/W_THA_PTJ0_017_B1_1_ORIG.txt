It is important for college students to have a part-time job. When we talk about the part-time job, I usually think about the job in the internet that is not safety in everything such as, employer, task or process of work and money. Why I think that, because to work in part-time job we doesn't know the employer before. However the part-time job doesn't mean the job on the internet only but it means any job from anywhere. I think that a part-time job is important to many people while it not important to many people also. The case of college students I think it not important to have a part-time job because, we got a pocket money from their parents. Therefore, it not necessary to have a part-time job but I don't mean a part-time job is not good. I think that it very necessary for many college students also because, we must do not forget it at most of college students are poor. Therefore, they need to have a part- time job for get more money for pay daily life, it is very necessary for them. In conclusion, I think it depends on how necessary for working part-time job, it is very personal reason to do that.
