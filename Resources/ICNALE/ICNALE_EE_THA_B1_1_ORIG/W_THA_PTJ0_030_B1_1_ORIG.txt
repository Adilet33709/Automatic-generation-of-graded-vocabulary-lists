If you ask me Is it important for college students to have a part-time job? I think I can't answer you directly. Because I'm the one who never have the part-time job. But one thing that I can say is the part-time job has two side of it. In positive, it will give you an experience in life. Example is when you have some problems, it will teach you what should you do to solve the problems, even if you might not like your job. Then you will know this kind of job that you took is your style or not. It the way that teach you how can find your please job in the future! In negative, you must study and working in the same time that can cause you so many problem. Your grade may be drop if your take yourself in the job too much. Or the problem about your study can make you worry when you work, then you can not work as well as you can. But somebody can manage it! They know how to use the time for their life not especially for the part-time job and study but also for their friends, family, or may be their boyfriend/girlfriend. But not everybody can do that. So you can not say that have a part-time job during you still study is good. This case of thinking is up to the person. You can say that is good or bad but there is no truly answer. The answer is the thing that you must find it with your self.
