It is reported by the World Health Organization that there are more than five million death caused by smoking. It is easy to see that smoking is very bad for our health. What's worse, second hand smoking hurt our body when we have no sense. This problem is so serious that we have to do something to protect ourselves. The most effective and easiest suggestion is banning smoking at all the restaurant in the country. Most people in the world don't like to smoke and large numbers of them even hate it because of its uncomfortable gas. So ban smoking not only meets people's will, but also save their life. The tobacco is also very expensive, which means smoking waste a lot of money, so quite smoking can also save money. The restaurant is the most important pubic place in our daily life so that banning smoking here can make the biggest and best effect. We do not want to be hurt when we have a good time, which is very disappointed. Another reason is that restaurant is a closed place which air is very hard to flow and people do not move often so that the bad gas can't discharge and cause great harm. There is not any benefit we can take from smoking, and smoking hurt smokers' and others' health greatly. So smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.
