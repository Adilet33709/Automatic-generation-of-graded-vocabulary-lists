As a college student, we aren't very busy so that we can spend a lot of time in doing the things we like. Some students do sports, such as playing football, running. Some students play computer games, such as dota, dnf. Some students read books, such as novels, poetry. What I think the most important thing we should do in the free time is doing a part-time job. College is an important place connecting school and society. We do not only learn knowledge here, but also learn experience which we can't learn from class. So having a part-time job can solve this problem. In fact, a part-time job can make our college life substantially. From the part-time job, we can learn how to deal with work problem, how to work with others. We can also develop good habit. What is the most important; we can understand how hard the making money is, so that we can make a good preparation for the later life. College life is colorful, so we don't need to study too hard as senior high school. We should learn to allocate our time and know what we really need. Having a part-time job is important to us; it's not only an opportunity, but also a challenge.
