Nowadays, college education has attracted the attention of society. What should the college education be? What ought college students to learn? The most common argument is whether college students should take a part-time job. In my opinion, having a part-time job is vital for students. As we all know, students have a lot of free time to manage, so it is very convenient for students to take a part-time job. In the future, we must step into the society and face a variety of difficulties, having a job can help us gain the life experience, what's more, we can meet all walks of people and learn to know how to cope with complex relationships between us and colleagues. Else, we can make our own money and we may realize it is hard for parents to earn money. But it also has unfavorable aspect. The main task for students is study, having a job may possess most of the free time and may affect students' daily life. Taking a part-time job is not a bad thing as long as we do not overstate it but stick to reality and personality. I think if we can manage our time precisely to take a job, we will be sure to get lots of benefits and get more chances to be distinguished in the future.
