No one can deny the fact that smoking is harmful to health, even the cigarette packaging says that. As lots of researches have shown time and again, quitting smoking contributes to the decrease of lung cancer incidence. And with every month that passes, there is more research showing the benefits of quitting, and the drawbacks of not quitting. Obviously, it is high time we took some measures to solve this problem, and the smoking ban does help a lot. To start with, the smoking ban is the wave of the future. During recent years, people have paid more and more attention to their physical conditions. On some public occasions, like restaurants, people are forced to inhale second-hand smoke. Non-smokers long exposed to second-hand smoke suffer even more harm than the smokers. Furthermore, for the smokers, if they know smoking is banned at restaurant, they may smoke later. And since they can't see other people smoke, their desire for the cigarette may abate. Over a span of time, they may be less addicted to the cigarette. Lastly, smoking ban also brings benefits to our society, contributes to a better social morality. Honestly, we still have a long way to go about the smoking ban, but we can reach the goal step by step. As far as we can see, smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country is a good policy. Only in this way can we finally make the smoking ban come true!
