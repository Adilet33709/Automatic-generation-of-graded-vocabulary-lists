Nowadays, quite a number of college students are taking part-time jobs. But is it necessary for them to do so? In my opinion, the answer can be various, depending on the students themselves. Undoubtedly, taking a part-time job is a special experience which provides youths with the chance to get close to society as well as to gain more practical skills. In the process, the students learn how to communicate with different kinds of people and how to deal with challenging situations. Besides, the money they get from the job will certainly reduce the burden of their parents more or less. However, it can't be ignored that some students fail more important things in order to take part-time jobs. They spend time which should be for learning to work, thus leading to decline of grades. But the fact is that the first thing for students is still study. Also, some young people fail to spend their money reasonably. Instead, they fall into the habit of wasting money. So, it can be concluded that taking a part-time job is rewarding and eye-opening for those who have good self-regulation but it may have some side effects if the student doesn't have a good plan. In common with many things, part-time job is a double-edged sword. If you want to take it, do be careful.
