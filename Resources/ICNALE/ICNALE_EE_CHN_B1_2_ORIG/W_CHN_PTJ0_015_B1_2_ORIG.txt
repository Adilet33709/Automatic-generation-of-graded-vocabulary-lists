There is a controversial debate on part-time jobs, including whether we should take a part-time job and how much time we should spend on a part-time job. It is natural that people from different backgrounds hold divergent attitudes towards the issue. People in favor of having a part-time job claims that a part-time job can release their financial burdens. It is common for a young man to bear a loan from the bank for some reason and support his family or himself. So a part-time job even may entertain the person as well as bring in money, if the job is just his or her interest. In this way, people will make full use of our lifetime and be energetic all the time. While people who hold the opposite opinion argue that a part-time job will take on a big share of our attention and may lead you to a poor health. You cannot focus your full attention on your main work. And that is why part-time jobs are banned in lots of companies. For my part, I would side with the first point of view. Part-time jobs do will fulfill our spare time when we have the passion to do something interesting and attracting. So seek a part-time job, and be rich both in wealth and spirit.
