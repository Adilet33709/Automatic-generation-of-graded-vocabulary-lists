Along with the rapid development of society, more and more problems are brought to our attention, on of with which is that our health is weaker than times, may 100 years ago, when our parents are teenagers. There are so many bad habits accounting for the issue. However, smoking is one of the concerns, particularly smoking in public places. If people ask me whether we should ban smoking in public places like restaurants. As far as I am concerned, we should ban a smoking on the unsuitable situations, particularly in restaurants. Firstly, you are harming the heath of people around you unconsciously, no matter you are willing to or not. It is unfair for others to bear the bad influence. People come to have meals in the restaurants; they don't come here to get harmed by the smoke. At the second place, it is considered impolite smoking before many non-smokers. Gentlemen will never smoke before a lady speak ill of smoking. Last but not least, smoking is obviously breaking down your health, wherever you smoke. Cigarettes contain a variety of poisonous materials. Thinking into account all the above, we can easily draw the conclusion that banning smoking in the public place is essential and getting rid of smoking is also necessary. So we should ban smoking completely in the restaurants for both smokers and nonsmokers' health.
