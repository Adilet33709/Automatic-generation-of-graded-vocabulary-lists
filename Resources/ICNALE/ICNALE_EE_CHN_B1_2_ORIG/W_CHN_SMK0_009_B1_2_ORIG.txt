It is a common sense that smoking does harm to people's health a lot. Thus, I am for the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As we all know, a small cigarette contains a great amount of harmful substances. Undoubtedly, the one smoking constantly exposes his lungs to those substances, which, according to many researches, damages not only the lungs but also the heart and digesting system. Besides, those second hand smokers are refugees as well. Although they are not addicted to smoking, they will be affected unconsciously when staying in a room full of poison smoke. The restaurant is a place where people enjoy themselves by eating delicious food. As a result, a clean and comfortable environment should be provided instead of one that is full of cigarette smoking. At least, the health of the children cannot be ignored. In a word, there is very reason that we should do something. In fact, some countries have banned smoking in public places years ago. Facing increasing rate of diseases caused by smoking, we may as well try to takes forceful measure, such as making laws, to reduce smoking in public places. And now, stopping smoking in all public places.
