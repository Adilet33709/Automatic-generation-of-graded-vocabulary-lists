Society has more and more challenges for college students. So it is important for us to have much experience. In our country there are plenty of college students undertaking a part-time job or even more than one part-time job. It's quite common to see students to be busy after classes. But why is it important for us to get these? First, I think part-time jobs are a good way to count our thumbs. College isn't as busy as high school. When we finish our study, so much time is waste for playing computer games or doing other boring things. If a part-time job belongs to us, we will try our best to do it. After all, that's a way to show the ability we have. Second, part-time jobs can help us knowing more people. Colleges just have students and teachers. But society has quite different people. They do all kinds of work, and experience interesting things you have never heard. Through your part-time job you could get good interpersonal relationship. After you graduated, you will go to society. When you need help, these people can give it to you. Finally, it is the most important one. The key point is you can get the experience the book can't teach you. Practice is the way which could check the truth. If you only can talk about how to do it, no one will believe you. You have to study what should you do. And part-time jobs would let you knowing those. So college students' having a part-time job is necessary and important.
