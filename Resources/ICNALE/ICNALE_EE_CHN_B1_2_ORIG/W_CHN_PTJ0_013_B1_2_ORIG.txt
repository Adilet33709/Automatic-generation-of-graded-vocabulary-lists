Nowadays many people hold a pessimistic attitude towards college students' behavior, having part-time jobs. Whereas, as for me, it is important for college students to have part-time jobs. First and foremost, it is a perfect oppotunity for experence-lacked college students to practice themselves. Part-time jobs open a new door for innocent students to touch and learn to adapt to the complex society, which can broaden their horizens and strengthen their abilities. Secondly, taking part-time jobs is also an approach to relaxing. As we know, all work and no play make Jack a dull boy. Then getting along with various kinds of people and working in a group bring a fresh feeling during part-time jobs. Last but not least, college students can also earn money via part-time jobs, which can help to support their life and realize the hardship behind every coin. As to those excuses for denying part-time jobs, it is a waste of time and has a bad impact on study. I don't think they are according. As mentioned above, taking part-time jobs is meaningful, which not only strengthen themselves, but also make them mature enough to set foot in the society. As to study, what is known to all is that appropriate practice contributes to study by combining the theory to practice. All in all, taking part-time jobs should be encouraged among college students.
