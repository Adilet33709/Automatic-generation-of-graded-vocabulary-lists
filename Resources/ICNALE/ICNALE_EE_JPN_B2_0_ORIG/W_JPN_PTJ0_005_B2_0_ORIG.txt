I agree with it. Because they need a training to work before graduate. Studying in college is very different from working in society. If they don't study hard that is a personal problem. But if employees don't work hard that is not a personal problem. And if they have a part-time job they can get a lot to learn. For example responsibility, hospitability, communication skills, how to solve problems, and so on. And they will quickly get used to working when they have a full-time job as they have experiences to work. But working in college days is not the only thing to do. Of course they need to study and reading. If they don't study their college fee is no use. However a lot of students tend to take their time to work for money that they can use for what they want. They need a social training but they have to understand what is important to do now. They can work as much as they want after graduate. But college life is only one time for many students. So it is important for college students to have a part time job, and it is also important for them to study. Balance is a key to success their college days.
