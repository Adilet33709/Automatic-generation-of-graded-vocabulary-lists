I think college students should not spend time on part-time jobs. I think college students should do things what they can do only when they are college students. For example, read many books, go for a trip, play sports, take part in club activities, etc. Indeed you'll have some time for these after starting to work for a company, but there will be less time. Like many people say, You can work as much as you like after graduating college. The only problem is, that all the money you use for these experiences are earned by your parents, not you. So you must be careful not to waste money and time. You should always keep in your mind that time is finite. As long as you think the things you are going to do are necessary for your future, you should do it. So, if are willing to be a owner of a restaurant in the future, having a part time job at a restaurant might rather be a good experience than just reading books about managing or foods. But for my opinion, I think students should read books. Reading books of various realms will surely do a positive effect in your future.
