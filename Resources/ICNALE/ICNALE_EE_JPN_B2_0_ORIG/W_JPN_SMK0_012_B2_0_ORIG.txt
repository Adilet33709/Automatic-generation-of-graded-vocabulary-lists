I disagree with this statement. In my opinion, smoking should not be banned completely in two reasons. First, smoker has a right to smoke as long as it doesn't become a nuisance to public people. In the restaurant, if they make some area or tables for smokers, smoking will not trouble other people. In some public place where we can't separate non-smoker from smoker such as sidewalks in a big city or platform at station during rush hour, I think, of course, we should ban smoking completely. But if we just set the table for smokers, no problem could be happen. Actually, at many restaurants they arrange tables for both people (smoker and non-smoker), and this is consider to be a good idea and seems to have been succeeded. Second, if smoking were banned completely at all restaurants, smokers will hesitate to enter restaurants. In this situation, the profit of restaurants would be decreasing and at last economy would also be going down. It is true that the number of people who are smoking is decreasing, but there are still large numbers of people who enjoy smoking. I have a friend who smokes very often. He said that he didn't want to go to a restaurant in which smoking is banned. So, if we shut out those people from restaurants or café, there would be negative impact on Japanese Economy. As I said above, I disagree with the statement that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in Japan.
