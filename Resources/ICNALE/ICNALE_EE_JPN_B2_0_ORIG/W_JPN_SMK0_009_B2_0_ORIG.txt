I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country in terms of the health of the customers and the benefit of the restaurants. First, smoking has a bad effect on the customers both physically and mentally. Even if smoking area and non-smoking area are divided, smoke can invade into the non-smoking area. As a result, customers who are in non-smoking area end up with receiving the second hand smoke. It is said that the second hand smoking is more harmful for the health of a man than first hand smoke. In addition, the bad smell of the smoke makes non-smoking customers feel uncomfortable. In other words, smoking in restaurants harm customers in a both physical and mental way. Second, smoking does harm to the benefit of the restaurant. There are some people who are unwilling to go to the restaurants where smoking is allowed whether completely or partially. In fact, when I chose a restaurant, I try not to enter the restaurant which does not ban smoking completely. I know that some of my friend and family behave in the same way. As a result of this, in the case where a restaurant does not ban smoking completely, it gathers less customers than if it banned smoking. This leads to the less benefit of the restaurant. In conclusion, in order to avoid these two bad effects of smoking which I discussed here, restaurants should ban smoking completely.
