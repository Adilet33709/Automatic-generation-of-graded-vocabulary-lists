I agree with this idea, mainly because there are many people who don't like smoke by smoking. Especially at the restaurants, people who don't smoke may think that they want to taste the dishes without confused by smoke. Moreover, nowadays the number of people who don't smoke is becoming large in Japan. In other wards, the number of people who don't want to take their seats near the smoking people in the restaurants is growing. Therefore, restaurants that are not banned to smoke may lose their customers who don't smoke. For example, if there are two restaurants that the one is banned to smoke and the other is not, I will chose the one that is completely banned to smoke because I hate the smokes in the restraints. People who love smoking should go to cigar bar not to the restaurants. And both of restaurants and bars can continue to attract the customers. In addition, I think that making smoking-area and non-smoking area costs restaurants a lot of money. They must prepare some goods to divide the two areas and the clerks must spend their time to do so and to ask their customers that which area is good for them. To ban smoking is good for both of customers and restaurants.
