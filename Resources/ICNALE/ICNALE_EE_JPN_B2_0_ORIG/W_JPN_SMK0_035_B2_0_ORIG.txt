I agree with the statement because of the following reasons. First, when we breathe the smoke, we sometimes cough or have a throat ace. That is a bad thing for us. Second, the smell of smoke is very bad. Some people may think that everyone should tolerate the smell, because smoking gives smokers refresh like as drink makes people refresh. So, they think smoking in restaurants is not a bad thing. However, there is a serious problem in smoking. For, smoke from cigarette contains many harmful products like nicotine. Such products are said to lead us death with cancer. Moreover, they harm not only smokers but also people near them. Smoking gives us not so much refresh as illness. In Japan, smoking sheets are separated from non-smoking sheets in many restaurants, but they are not completely separated. For, when we sit on the non-smoking sheets, smoke comes into the area and we breathe such bad things. That makes no means to separate the sheets. Japanese restaurants sometimes have enough space, so I think it difficult to separate them completely. If smoking were banned in every restaurant, we have no trouble of smoking. So, stores like restaurants should be banned smoking.
