I agree with this statement. In my opinion, there are two big reasons. Firstly, we can get money. College students need a lot of money for many things. For me, it's really important to go out with friends and go shopping, go to stylish café, and drink. I can't survive without money from my part time job. Some people get money from their parents, but I don't want to bother my parents. They already pay for my school and lent, it costs a lot. I think I have to earn money for my amusement fee by myself. And another reason is that we can get valuable experiences. We meet new people and learn about service for customer, how difficult or hard to get money before we graduate school. I could thank to my parents as I knew what to make money and how hard. Also I learned about the service manner. It would be useful when I get a job. Of course studying is the most important things for students, but we won't be able to get this kind of experience in university. I think experiences from part time job is as value as class in school. That's why I agree with having a part time job.
