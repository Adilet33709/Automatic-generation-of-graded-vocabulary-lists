I can't agree with the idea. I think that study is more important for college students than having a part-time job. Of course, if college students could do both hardly, it was best. But most of them, at least around of me, can't do so. Especially, students of national college are given a lot of money by country for going to college and studying. Therefore I think they must study hard to become the people who are helpful for doing something. Sometimes I heard the opinion saying like following. College students should have a part-time job because it gives them many experiences to live social. I think doing various things is good for young people, too. But, at the same time, I think it is ridiculous to have part-time job that spends a lot of times though all of the rewards are just money. Seen in long span, it must be good for college students to study hard about their specials than spend their precious time on a part-time job. Studying is making their career. If they must pay their college fee by themselves, they should do some part-time job. But, if their parents or country do so, they should have a part-time job to live or to study not to play.
