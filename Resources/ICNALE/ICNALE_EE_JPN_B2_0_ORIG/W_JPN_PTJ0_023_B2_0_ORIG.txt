I disagree with this statement. I have three reasons to support my opinion. Firstly, students cannot concentrate on their college studies if they have a part-time job. I think that the most important work for students is studying. However, if they have a part-time job, they have to spare a lot of their time for their part-time job. Thus, they tend not to be able to focus on their studies in college. I know some of my friends, who have a part-time job and spare most of their time for it, almost always take a nap during their classes. It is because they work hard until mid-night for their part-time job and can sleep only four or five hours in the night time. Like this example, having a part-time job prevents college students from studying. Secondly, having a part-time job sometimes damages students' health. As I mentioned above, because of their part-time job, some students cannot have enough sleep. This affects serious damages for their health. Also, their job requires them to work several hours, sometimes seven or eight hours a day, so they tend to lose their regular diet. Therefore, having a part-time job causes serious damages for students' health. Finally, students tend to waste of money if they have a part-time job. Although there are few exceptions, most students are given a financial support by their parents. Thus, such students do not have to pay their college fee and such kinds of fee on their own. It means they can freely use money which they earn for their part-time job. Thus, some students tend to buy very expensive things without a reflection. For these three reasons, I disagree for the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
