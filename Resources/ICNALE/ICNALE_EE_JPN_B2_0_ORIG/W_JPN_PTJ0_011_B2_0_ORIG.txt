I agree with this statement because I think they can prepare many things which are important after graduating through a part-time job. They can learn what they are good at and how to speak to others. They can understand what they are good at or not. There are some types of part-time job, teaching, delivering, cooking, customer service and so on. Home teacher, say, is a typical job for college students. Those who have no idea of his/her future may want to be a teacher through home teachers. Or, if those who want to be a teacher may change his/her dream because he/she realizes him/herself not good at teaching. So it's a good chance for college students to know themselves. Next, it is important to speak politely when we speak to others such as boss, strange people and so on. Only spending their time in college, they almost speak to friends and they have few chances that they have to speak politely. So in order to learn how to speak to others, it is valuable for college student to have a part-time job. So as I said, they can learn what they can do and how important to be polite is thorough a part-time job.
