I agree with it. First of all I really hate smell of smoke. That smell is very strong and it is not go away until I take a bath and take off my cloth. It is very uncomfortable. Once the smell stick with me, I have to be with it all day. I can't believe it. Second of all, restaurants are public places. Everyone is in there and also babies and old people who can't protect their body strongly. Public places should be safe. Besides people usually have a good time with family or friends having a delicious meal and enjoying their conversations in a restaurant. Anyone can't break their time. Smokers should put up with smoking in restaurants. Because it is only an hour or more. Last of all, smoking is nothing but poison for smokers and people who are in that place. It is so harmful that it causes lung cancer. Now everyone knows it. It is same as a crime to smoke in public places. It hurts people. Though the bad influence is invisible at that time. But it is sure that smoking destroys our health. So it is natural that smoking is banned in public places.
