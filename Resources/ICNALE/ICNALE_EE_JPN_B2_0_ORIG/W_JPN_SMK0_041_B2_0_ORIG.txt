I agree with the statement that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. I'm going to write why I think this way by comparing the merits and demerits of the situation. Now, imagine that all the restaurants in the country ban smoking. As many of you know, smoking gives us nothing good especially when it came to medical field. The smoke contains a lot of chemicals and some of them are the cause of lung cancer. In addition, it has turned out that the smoke does more harm to those who are around the smoker than it does to the smoker himself. Therefore, if there's nobody to smoke in a restaurant, it means that nobody is exposed to the danger of taking the bad chemicals of smoke. I think this is a merit of banning smoking in a restaurant. Some people might want to smoke even in the restaurants. Those people might not come to restaurants as they used to do, since they are never allowed to smoke in the restaurants. Decreasing the number of the customers can affect the financial state of restaurants, and give the economic minus influence. This is a demerit of banning smoking in a restaurant. It is true that some people can feel cannot do without cigarette. However, I think such people are already the patient of smoking addiction. What they should do is not smoke in a restaurant and risk the health of both other people's and theirs: they should consult their doctor. In the first place, restaurant should be a place where people enjoy their meals. Therefore I think banning smoking at all the restaurants in the country is really a good idea.
