I agree with the statement. Some people may think that there are demerits for students to do a part-time job. These people worry about that students spend a lot of time for the job and they will not have enough time to study. However, I think that their worry is nonsense. For, students know the importance of study, and they will study in vacant time. I think there is more merit of doing a part-time job than the demerit because of the following reasons. First, I think that doing a part-time job will help students' parents. Doing a part-time job makes students get extra money. Thanks to that extra money, some poor parents who cannot earn enough money for their child to go to college can let their children to go there. Second, doing a part-time job makes students promote independence from their parents in economical part, and they can realize the importance of money. Third, the most important reason I think, it is useful for them to experience job before they work at company. If they do a part-time job, they can take responsibility and get many skills for job, for example, greeting, conversation, presentation and so on. So, they will be able to work better than those who have never experienced a job. That's why I think doing a part-time job is important for students.
