I agree with this statement because smoking is bad for other customers and restaurants. I'll talk about why smoking is bad for other customers. It's bad for health and enjoying food. As it is known widely, smoking is worse for receivers of its smoke than smokers itself. There are many people including of course children. To avoid healthy problem of non-smokers and children, smoking should be banned. And it's bad for eating food. In my case, I cannot enjoy eating if others smoke. I have a terrible headache when I feel the smell of smoke. How can I enjoy the food! Even if smoking zone is separated, I feel the smell of smoke when I go to the bathroom or something like a drink-bar. Then as I said, I feel a headache. So it's a good idea to separate smoking zone, but it's the best to ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country. And next, I'll tell you why it's bad for restaurants. When I see people who smoke in the restaurant, I always wonder if they enjoy its taste. I think they don't. Smells and tastes are gone away with smoking. Restaurant is a place we enjoy eating and restaurants must think they want customers to enjoy its taste. So if restaurants surely think so, they must ban smoking to let customers enjoy its delicious food. Smoking is bad for other customers and restaurant. So smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
