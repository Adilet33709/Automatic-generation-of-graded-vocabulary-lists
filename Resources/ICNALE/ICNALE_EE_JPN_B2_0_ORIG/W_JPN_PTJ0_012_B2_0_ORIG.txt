I agree with the statement. There are two reasons that I support this opinion. First, part-time jobs are the only opportunity to experience what or how the job is, before entering a company. Before entering universities(even after entering them), all most no students haven't decided what type of jobs they want to do or which company they are interested in. For those students, part-time jobs are good chance to find a job which they truly want to do. And also, in Japan, once we enter a company, it's very difficult to quit the job and to find another job, even if the job is uncomfortable, but you could have many part-time jobs and quit them easily. I myself had been working in the clam school, and I learned really a lot of thing. Second, most university students don't receive their allowance from their parents, so, in fact, they have to work to earn money for leisure activity, payment of mobile phone, or dating with their boy/girl friend. And in some club whose club dues are high, all members do a part time job as a club activity. For them, part-time jobs are a very important for their daily lives. To conclude, I strongly suggest to university student that they try to experience part-time jobs as much as possible, as long as they become an obstacle to studying.
