I agree this statement. I have two reasons to support my opinion. Firstly, to ban smoking at all restaurants, people who do not smoke can be guarded from smoking air. Recently in Japan, more and more restaurants have separated a smoking section from non-smoking section, and at most restaurants, you can choose the section. However, there are still some problems. Firstly, there is still high possibility for non-smokers to breathe smoke, for example, non-smokers cannot choose a non-smoking section if the section is not vacant. In this case, they have to take seats in a smoking section, and they automatically breathe smoke. Also, just separating the sections cannot prevent non-smokers from breathing smoke perfectly. Even if separating a smoking section from a non-smoking section, two of them are still in the same restaurant. Thus non-smokers are not guarded from smoking air perfectly. In addition, clerks should also be considered. Even if there are a smoking section and a non-smoking section in the restaurant, it totally does not concern to the clerks. Therefore, the clerks cannot be guarded from smoke. Secondly, banning smoking at restaurants helps smokers to try to stop smoking. If smoking is not accepted at restaurants, smokers cannot smoke at restaurants. I think it makes smokers think to try to stop smoking. It is very nice for their health. For these two reasons, I agree with this statement.
