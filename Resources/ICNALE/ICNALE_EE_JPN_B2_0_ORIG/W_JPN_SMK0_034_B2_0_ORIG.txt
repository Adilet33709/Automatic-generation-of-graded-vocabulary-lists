I disagree with the statement. There is a prevailing opinion. Since a restaurant is a place to eat, it shouldn't be covered with smokes of cigarettes, in order not to spoil the foods. This opinion sounds valid, but who in the world made a rule that foods should always be eaten in clean places ? Actually, the opinion is by people who do not smoke. The majority. How about the opinions of people who want to smoke while eating? Also, from the point of view of diversity, I think there can be some people who smoke. A world where everyone is behaving the same will be just boring. People smoking look somewhat cool. There's also an opinion referring to the bad effects smoking causes to your health, but I think just a few minutes being exposed to the smokes while you eat won't give you a fatal effect, unless you go and eat at restaurants for about twenty times a week. But for my real opinion, I don't really care whether people smoke at restaurants or not, because I don't go to restaurants so often. Many people must be the same. There are many cooking books you can buy at bookstores, and you can make meals tasty enough by yourself.
