I agree the in pubic restaurant is should be banned smoking. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. This is a good idea though it takes away some of our freedom. As we know, smoking is harmful not only to our health but also to the environment. Smoking can lead to many diseases, such as lung cancer. Smoking affects non-smokers more than it does smokers. Ratio of passive smokers getting ill is higher than that of smokers. So, many nonsmokers are against smoking. Therefore, that the government ban smoking is very necessary and important to us. It is a measure to protect our health and environment. So many people, especially nonsmokers are agree with policy. Some people say that it takes away some of our freedom. I think it is a one-sided view. If one wants to smoke, he may smoke in private, not in pubic restaurant. In fact, smokers still have the freedom of smoking. But, I think, smokers had better give up smoking, not only in private places, but also in pubic restaurant, everywhere. It will be beneficial to all of us. Every one thought is different, the smoking and against smoking people, must thought fine communication achieve the no smoking in pubic restaurant goal, together protect we're health and environment.
