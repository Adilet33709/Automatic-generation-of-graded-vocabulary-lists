I agree the student should be part time job. Above all a university man, they are more comfortable in life, so the parents must demand their child searching the part time job, than told this is independent. Firstly, the university man is understanding making a living is hard, and to increase income and decrease expenditure. For example, at the hot weather standing eight hours for hand a fly sheet in passerby, absolute very tired. They are not only save the money at bank but barely to draw the money in bank. That is the money is hard to earn money. Secondly, more and more college students choose to take part-time jobs in or outside school. At the beginning, they couldn't do well at all and often made mistakes. Gradually, could do a very good job, then they felt very excited when I received a pay for the first time. Encourage meself made up my mind to find another part-time job in every chance. Finally, the university man is can learn how deal with the relationship between working and learning. If they can balance it well, we can think are sure to get enough knowledge as well as working experience, so as to get ready for you future success.
