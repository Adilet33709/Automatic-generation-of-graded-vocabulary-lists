I agree smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have two ways to instruction it. First, for personal health, I've heard a sentence "Health is Wealth", it means that who has a healthy body to keep oneself in well situation than perhaps has a lot of money in personal life! Smoking can encourage body sick, when someone smoking that can break himself/herself body a lot! Especially cancer. For example, when someone smoking that fog will through mouth, throat, although arrive heart. Day after day body can't restore health; it's a big question in life! Second, for friends, neighborhood, classmates or stranger all of our around, second-hands smoking is terrible, because it has bad composition more than smoker. Almost people don't like let him/herself do something them don't like. So the reason is for personal health and second-hands smoking, I agree smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. But I know this ban maybe make smoker unhappy, because this ban let smoker can't smoking everywhere. I think they still have smoking habit in himself/herself life, but this ban is based on everybody is fair, so when smoker want to smoke at restaurant who must be think other people's wish.
