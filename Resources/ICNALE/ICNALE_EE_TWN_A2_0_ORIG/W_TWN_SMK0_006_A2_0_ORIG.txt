Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I approve that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Not only it makes the restaurants have a nice looking, but also let everybody has a good meal time in the restaurant without smoking. For example, I had a date with my friends in the restaurant which is nearby our neighborhood. A lot of people spoke and yelled loudly even drinking too much. However, the most important was that some people who looked like evil men were smoking continuously. It smelled so disgusting that I feel a little dizzy. I really unhappy, but I could do nothing to forbid. All I should do was leaving the restaurant. That why I agree that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. Many people are dating, chatting, studying in the restaurants. I think that smokers are bad who let other people get the second-smoking. In addition, according to the research, smelling the second-smoking people is easier get disease than smokers. Without health, we can't enjoy the good things in our life. To sum up, No smoking at all the restaurants in the country is a good way. And I hope it can apply to every place.
