I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job, because college students have to learn something example how to make money, and Spend own money. If do not work is unable to realize the money the significance, will cause itself only randomly to spend money. Certainly because some university students the Gary economic agent can not but work earn the living expenses are also one of reasons. But works may not too surpass own elevating capacity, in order to avoid the schoolwork could not bear, instead the gain does not equal the loss, like this lost the significance which worked. Although present's university student will have more than half person to go to work, but will work with the studies proper attention to both person are not actually many, although will work may shift to an earlier time the attempt different society experience in the student profession, may also lighten some burdens for the parents, but if too will take seriously to work lets the studies be unable to give dual attention leads is only unable to graduate, instead will make itself to increase the expense which will repair, if will therefore let the student assign works with the studies time can conflict not mutually, will be very important.
