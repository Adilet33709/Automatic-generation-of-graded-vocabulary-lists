I think the university during the period. We should try to work time. But. Achievement is very important. So. We should be appropriate to do part-time jobs. Should be based on academic oriented. When you find part-time work will affect your Studies. They should concentrate on their studies. After all. Student work is to study and graduate. Part-time work is very important. But not the most important then study. If will not affect my academic performance. I think I will try to do part-time job. It is good for students to have part-time jobs because this helps cultivate independence among young people. After-school work enhances a young person's social development. After-school work teaches students how hard it is to earn money and helps develop thriftiness in our younger generation. Because they earn money, students can pay for their education and thus will value their education even more. And, in return, their experience will make them know better what they have learned in classes and books. Part-time work allows us to learn many things. But do not spend too much time on part-time work. I believe. When we graduated from university. Part-time work is clearly very small salary. But we learned some life experience before. Part-time work Obviously some people are good. These experiences are important
