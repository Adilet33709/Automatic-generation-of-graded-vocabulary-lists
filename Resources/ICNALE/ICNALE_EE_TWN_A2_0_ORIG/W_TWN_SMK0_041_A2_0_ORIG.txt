I can't agree. I think smoking should be absolutely prohibited in the restaurants because it will affect the health of the non-smokers there. This is an unfair event. Although smoking is not an illegal behavior, it is really a bad deed to force others to breathe in second-hand smoke. Therefore, I think smoking in the restaurants should surely be banned. Moreover, the number of customers will decrease because some people are afraid of second-hand smoke in the restaurants and avoid going there. This makes the restaurants suffer from financial loss. Three years ago, I had my dinner in a restaurant. While I was eating, I smelt a kind of disgusting odor. At that moment I discovered someone smoking. So, I forwarded my complaint to the staff of the restaurant. But, the staff said that the smokers had the rights of smoking there since there had not been any law to restrain them. I was extremely angry then. Luckily there have been laws to restrain the smokers nowadays. This is good news for the non-smokers. It allows Taiwan to have fresh air that will no longer polluted by smokers. Smoking is actually so annoying that the laws against it should be set up even earlier.
