I think this very important. Because college students have to work in future, if can get some experience by part-time job, I believe it good for you. In the work, can meet many different people, they maybe are your colleague, guest, and boss, you will through many thing with them, can learning many knowledge and interesting things to you. Sometime you can meet bad people, they can make trouble to you, you have to calm, don't angry, try use communication with they, in this process, and you can grow up of your mind. In the other, you can get money by part-time job, it can lower home expense, so, I support college students go to do part-time job. A example, I have do part-time job in Carrefour in summer vacation and winter vacation, in my colleagues, have come from south of Taiwan, he can tall to we have very things at quit time, it are very interesting and funny, let me understand very things, in the work, can meet very much guest, someone can't find the thing, but the thing at they front, someone can ask too stupid question, and the question is not any relation in my work, but after question can get a "thanks", I was content.
