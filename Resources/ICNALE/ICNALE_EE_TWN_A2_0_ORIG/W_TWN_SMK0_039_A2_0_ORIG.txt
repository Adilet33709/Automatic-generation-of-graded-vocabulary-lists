Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country I would argue that people should have the right to choose whether they smoke or not. BUT. People should not smoke in a room where there are non-smokers but surely they should be free to smoke elsewhere smoking must be banned. It not only spoils a particular person's health but it also affects his or her entire family. It's a curse. Today we are all sensible and we know what the disadvantages of smoking are, we must stop this Venom spreading in our society, country and home. In short. Public space should not be smoking. if I came into a restaurant, and while I was waiting for my food to come, I smell the smell of smoke. It makes me no appetite. Loss of appetite A LON TIME. In my opinion smoking should definitely be banned in public places as it not only has deleterious effects on the non smokers present there but also may cause allergic coughing to many people. Besides, many youngsters are fascinated by the act of smoking and try to imitate it which may later develop into a habit. All in all. Smoking in public places is not good behavior. We should try to ban people smoking in public places. To prohibit by law is obviously the best way
