Ⅰagree. I think a par time job has positive and negative effects. The advantage is that you can learn more about how to social with other people, this can help you to find jobs when you graduate. The disadvantage is you may need more time to study, or your grade will be bad that you may be flunked out of school. A part-time job can have both positive and negative effects on a person. First of all, one will be able to earn more money in order to pay their tuition, their rent, or buy whatever their heart desires. Moreover, one can learn how to socialize with others, thus beneficial when looking for a job upon graduation. On the other hand, the time needed for one to study diminishes. This can cause one's grades to drop drastically, which may in turn cause one to flunk. In conclusion, one should only get a part time job if they are able to handle their studies as well. Students, who have a part-time job, enter the society earlier than those who haven't. While working part-time, students experience how the society functions and learn to deal with issues maturely. Having a part-time job could give the students a hands-on experience to test their skills, and see whether they are interested in the job. As well, students working at an early age encounter the hardship of earning a living themselves; therefore, they treasure and view money differently. Students with a job could also help out their family finance.
