When we come to the topic of part time job, we will normally related it to most of the teenagers especially university students nowadays. However, this phenomenon has been widely questioned by most of the people today whereby most of the people think that the task for a student to go for a university is to study and gain knowledge instead of working and earn money. Hence, do part time job really good for a student or it gives bad impact to the students? The answer can be pros and cons; it is only based on personal opinion. For me, going for a part time job consists of more pros rather than cons. For example, students who go for a part time not only can earn extra income but also get to learn how to balance their work and study. They begin to learn how to financing their money well and of course when they are exposed to working life; they will definitely learn extra knowledge that will never teach in the school. For example, the way in communicating with their colleagues is totally different with the way they communicate with their friends. In addition, they also learn how to be more independent and responsible. No matter how, most of the students go for part time job are mainly due to financial problems such as they may having difficulty in paying their tuition fee and so on. Thus, one of the fastest ways to solve their problem will be go for a part time job. However, most of them will normally facing the problem of not enough sleep, absence for their classes due to he or she has part time job reason and so on. As a result, their performance in school may be get influenced. In conclusion, part time job can be a controversial topic as it may be pros to someone who are willing to learn but cons to someone who are actually weak in managing themselves.
