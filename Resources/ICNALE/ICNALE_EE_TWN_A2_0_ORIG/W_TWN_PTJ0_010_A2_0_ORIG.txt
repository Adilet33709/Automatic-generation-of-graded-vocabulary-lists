I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. In college, most students have part-time job in order to pay something, such as eat, transportation and so on. On the other hands, foreign books are very expensive. It costs about NT 1000. So far, I have part-time job. I think I had learned a lot from the part-time job. For instance, I improve my communication skill and get more self-confident. In 2009, every countries had faced economic recession, many people lost job. Maybe family faced that difficult problem. Due to deal with the problem, students have to get a par-time job. The situation is very common in global economic recession. If students have a part-time job, it can decrease parent's hard things. Everyone knows high education is most expensive. Having a part-time job reduces parent's burden and increase experience. Finally, I agree with having a part-time job in college. It is not only to earn money but also to learn a lot. We can make a lot of friends in different field. Getting a part-time job has a lot advantages if you deal with time management. If you are good at time management, having a part-time job is a good choice in college.
