I agree that is important for college students to have a part-time job. First, I'm a fresh man in society, and I want to find a job recently. When I mail my work plan or my work experience to employer, but always no answer. I try to find a explain, it's maybe cause my work experience less than other people. Second, part-time job can train personal time management for college students, a lot of college students used to be a super man, it means college students use a half of 24 hour to sleep, play computer, night active, and so on. But they can't spend time to rest, study, or doing something good! Third, part-time job can earn more cash. College students have more and more opportunity to join a lot of party or buy something I like; it needs money to do this. More and more family can't offer much more money to their child now, that perhaps think how to solve this question, and part-time job maybe can be useful!! So I think part-time job can train college students have more work experience, or be independent. So I agree a college student to have a part-time job is important.
