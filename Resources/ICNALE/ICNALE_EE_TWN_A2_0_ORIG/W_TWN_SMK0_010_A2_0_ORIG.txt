I agree that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. According to hospital statistics, smoking is bad for children, elderly and adults. Smoking can harm our health, especially lung. If you smoke a lot, you can cough a lot. On the other hands, buying cigarettes is very expensive, including health tax. If you could quit smoking, you can save a lot of money. In television the ad of banned smoking is popular. Most celebrities show in TV to tell everybody danger of smoking. For me, I hate that person who can smoke and be addicted. And I also hate the smell of smoking. Because my sister is a nurse, I learn a lot from her. She has taught me about danger of smoking. Smoking is very risky and harmful. I think nobody can smoke in public, especially restaurants. That behavior is banned strictly. Everyone should respect others. In public we should speak quietly and not smoke. I think government should make a strict rule. Restaurants can follow the rule. If smokers are at restaurant, they will get a fine. For everyone health, banned smoking in public is very important. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
