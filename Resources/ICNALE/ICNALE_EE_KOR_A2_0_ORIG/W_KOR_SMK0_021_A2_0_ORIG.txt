Nowadays, many people smoking cigarettes. But most of the smokers are high school students. Smoking is really harmful for teenagers and matures. Cigarettes are bad for your health and are not good mentally. Cigarettes are the cause of various illnesses such as cancers, and impotents. And cigarettes smokers know that already. And cigarette smokers give a negative sight. But smoking is not only bad for you. Cigarette smokers can have a joy at it and give a benefit to the nation because the price of the cigarettes has state tax. And cigarettes also become a favorite food for the smokers. You can choose to smoke if you want. I think to say STOP SMOKING is not good idea. If the smoker does not give damage for another people, I think we need not to say like that. We can make them a lot of smoking area for the smoker and the nonsmoker. I smoke cigarettes too. But my father said it will be good for you that cutting the cigarettes. So I am considering quitting cigarette. I think if I quit it, I can save my money and my health. Thank you for reading my essay and I will study hard in English.
