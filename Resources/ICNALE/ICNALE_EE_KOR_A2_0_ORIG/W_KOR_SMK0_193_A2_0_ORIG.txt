This day, smoking is banned in most public places and buildings. But the problem is that they having a smoking area. They banned smoking, but they have a smoking area, that is so ironic. Smoking should be banned in public places. Especially at a restaurant. Because, first of all, there is non-smokers. Non smokers don't want to smell cigar smoke. They are going to lunch or supper, not eat cigar. Even if smoker sits their area, smell is into there. And I feel like eat disgusted garbage. If you eat dinner with smoker, that is disaster. Because of him, you should be there smoking area. So non-smokers have to smell uncomfortable cigar smoke. In my case, I really hate breathing other person's smoke. Second, smoking causes the toxic disease. As you know, Smoking can cause lung cancer. That damages non-smokers' health more than smoker. Non-smoker just enjoys their dinner, but they also receive a bad present from smoker. Smoking produces all evil and no good. Some smoker says if people don't like me to smoke, they can leave. But I think fast better than you quit the smoke. Cigarette is a kind if drug. I wish the smoker would stop smoking.
