I agree that college students have a part time job. Because if college students have part time job, they improve sociality College students experience social life early They improve sociality than students don't have a part time job As a result, the students will get a job, they can adapt more easily Also, college students earn money themselves without their parents help Therefore they will know that money earning is very hard So, they think that money is precious. They easily don't spend money And money worry can reduce to parents. As college students earn money themselves Finally the reason I agree that college students have a part time job is making friends While they work part time job, they meet many people So they can make many friends and they meet various many people, they improve speaking skills Because of speaking skills very important to their life, improving speaking skills is helpful themselves College students have a part time job is many benefits for college students Therefore college students can better to experience part time job Their major related part time job is more effective If college students don't disturb study, they can have a part time job is very good
