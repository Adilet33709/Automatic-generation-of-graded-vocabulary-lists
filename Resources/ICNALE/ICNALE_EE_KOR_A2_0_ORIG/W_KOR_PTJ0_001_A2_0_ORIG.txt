Nowadays many students have a part-time job for their colleges' tuition. So it's going to be a problem because we have to do it especially private school. I think it is important for us however there are many shortages. First, we are student. The most important part to us is study. The chance of part-time job is always around you however the chance of study is not around you. For instance, there is someone who has started studying late. They thought part-time job is more important than study but they realized that study have to do in proper time. Therefore part-time job is not important than study. Second, we cannot concentrate on class. Generally, we usually do part-time job from the evening to the late at night. Therefore we cannot concentrate our class because of sleepiness. For example, I did night delivery service from 10:00pm to 6:00am. It is so hard in the first day, but I adapted to the environmental change so I slept during classes. Therefore part-time job disturb the concentration on class. Consequently, part-time job is become the social problem. Many news castings report it as the social problem. So the Government adopts a wise policy to concentrate study. The problem only can resolve from the Government because it's a hot potato for college students. We have to study for our future and part-time job is not the first.
