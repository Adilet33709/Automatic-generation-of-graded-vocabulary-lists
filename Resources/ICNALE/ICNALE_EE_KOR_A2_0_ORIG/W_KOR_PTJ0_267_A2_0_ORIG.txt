Is it important for college students to have a part time job in our country? I agree this opinion. Many college students need money for their school life. They want to do a lot, buy a lot of things, and eat a lot of food. However, they do not have enough money to do everything. So, they should earn the money. However, they cannot have a full time job because they are students the most important thing is studying. So, if they want to work, they should get a part time job. Of course, their parents give money to their son and daughter, but it is not enough to keep their life. Sometimes, when they work the owner does not give money on day. So many students cannot take the money though they work hard. So the country should make the law about this problem, and the owner should follow the this rule, when they hire the part time job students. In conclusion, the law should be made and the students should work hard to earn money for their life.
