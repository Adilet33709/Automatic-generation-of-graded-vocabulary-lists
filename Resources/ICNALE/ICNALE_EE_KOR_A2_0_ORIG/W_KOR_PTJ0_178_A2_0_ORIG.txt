I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are three reasons. First, students can build social experience by part-time job. After graduating from school, students start social life. However, if students start social life without social experience, they will meet difficulty. Therefore, doing social life is good thing in advance. Also, nowadays, when companies pick up a person, they prefer experienced people to not people. In order to get a job, they need too much social experience. Next, there is a second reason. They can live without the help of parents. They can earn money, and thank parents. Today, a lot of students need to help of parents, so a lot of parents help their son or daughter. However, when students have part-time job, they doesn't need to help of their parents. Finally, they can build friendship from person relation. They have to meet a lot of people and talk to them, because deal with people is difficult from social life. People dislike unkind, unfriendly and rude person, so, they can learn kind and friendly acting. Although there are a lot of reasons, I think it is the most important reason. For this reason, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
