There are many smokers in the world so non-smoker is damaged by them. Even in the public building they smoke honorably. I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country for three reasons. The first, we can help the poor kids. Many countries have increased cigarette taxes and also increased price so there are many people who cannot eat. We can help by stop buying cigarettes. In Korea, cigarette price is 2, 700won. By this money, we can give water, rice, bread and new life to the poor kids. That is, spending more valuable things can help someone. Second, secondhand smoking is a big health hazard. The smokers already knew that however they do not care the others' health even in the family. For example about 600, 000 People are died by secondhand smoking every year. Especially the fetus are more damaged and harmed directly by smokers. As the result, secondhand smoking can kill people. Lastly, there are many smoking area in the country. Because the government could not completely ban smoker from the smoking, they made many smoking area. Therefore, smokers keep this policy because it is at the least consideration to non-smokers. Consequently, from the reasons, we can help poor kids by stop smoking and smokers can damage non-smoker and the last there are many smoking area. So I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants for many people and many reasons.
