I think the college student's part-time job is important. Because of the tuition is getting higher. But all the parents get in trouble pay all the tuition. They are difficult to afford all the tuition for four years. So almost students have responsible for help their parents. But someone who the not rich is thinking I don't need to have a part-time job then the person isn't needed to have part-time job. Because doing the part-time job is optional. Not duty. But I think the person go to college should better have part-time job in every considered situation. First, they can help their parents who feel difficult to pay for their son's or daughter's tuition for four years. Of course, the money their earned can't fill all the tuition. But the money is not only touchable money. That is mind for their parents. And the money their earned can use their allowance. We can see this like small. But this is proud and big for them. I also agree this. Anyway, the second is they can go through out of the college. That is important. It is easy to people who go to college thinking I'm a just student. But college students are not just student. College is a one of the small society. So college students are members of society. So I think college student's part-time job is important.
