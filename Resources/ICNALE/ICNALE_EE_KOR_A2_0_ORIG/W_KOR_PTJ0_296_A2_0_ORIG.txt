I think that having part-time job is important to college students, because if we have a part-time job, we can grow up our responsibility. Many adults say that students should study hard rather than spending time on part-time jobs. However, I think part-time jobs of college students as they can learn importance of money and responsibility. The first reason is to get an experience. Working experiences are really important to get a job. Also, students can learn respecting other people. The second reason is to gain a valuable insight about a career. Before I go to real fields of work, I need to learn skills and knowledges for the work place, and I want to see which job is really fit to me. The last reason is to earn money. Many people who is University students want to get their own money, because they can pretty clothes and eat good food. However, we only shouldn't concentrate on getting a money, because we are student yet. We have to focus on studying subjects. Working for money might bother focusing on study, because It costs a lot of valuable time. I think most good way is getting a money in vacation, studying in semester. I believe having a part-time job is very beneficial for college students.
