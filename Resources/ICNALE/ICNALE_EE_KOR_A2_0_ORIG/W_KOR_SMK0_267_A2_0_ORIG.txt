I think the smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I agree this opinion. Many people smoke in our country. Smoking is really bad to people. I know the smoker cannot stop smoking. It is bad news for them. However, when they smoke at all the restaurants in the country the nonsmoker also get fog through the air. Although, the place is separated to parts one is for smoker another is for nonsmoker the fog flow through the air. It effects to nonsmoker. So the law should be made for nonsmoker. And then, it is also helpful to smokers. When they want to smoke if the smoking banned at all the restaurants in the country they should go out. It is uncomfortable. And if they work, it is really busy. They cannot make the time to smoke. Time goes by, they maybe stop smoking. Smoking is really bad for our body. If the people want to live healthy, stop smoking. It should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country and all the world.
