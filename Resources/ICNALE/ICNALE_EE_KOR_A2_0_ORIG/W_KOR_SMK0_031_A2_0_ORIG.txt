I think cigarette is a worst item in every situation. First, smoking looks not good. The person whose have smoking looks like gangster. Second, cigarette is not healthy. But if a smoker is smoking I can't scold to him the reason of only smoking. Because of smoking is just his choice. Third is very important thing that is smoking on the road. I have ever been this situation. When a smoker is smoking by walking I was his behind. I was very disgusting. Because of his blow with cigarette smoke is toward me. In fact, I have never been thought about smoking on the road before I went through this situation. But my mind has changed. The smokers whose have smoking on the road are very rude person. But now I think just smoking is not correct. Surely, if someone has smoking then the other person is suffered. So I can scold to them because I am suffered by them. Accordingly these contents, I think all places must have space for only smokers. Restaurants are not exception. Besides restaurant is a place to eat something but if someone has smoking other people get displeasured. So all smoker are smoking their place not to damage to other nonsmokers.
