I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the world. As one who hates smoking, smoking should be banned at all the public places as well as the restaurants in the world. Today, a lot of countries are banned smoking in the public place, but still a lot of countries don't ban smoking in the public places. So why ban smoking in the restaurants and the public places that will tell me reasons. There are three reasons. First, smoking damages other people. Smoking is a personal freedom, but smoking in the restaurant interfere freedom of others. Second, smoking is bad children's education and health. A lot of different people come to the restaurant. There is man, woman and child. When child comes to the restaurant, if setting guest next to child smoke, it is bad to child's health and education. The child think Finally, other guest is given unpleasant feeling by smoking especially in the restaurant. They eat delicious food, but smell bad smoke. They do not the smell. Also, they want to the naturally taste of food. But if together smoke, they can't the naturally taste of food. For this reasons, I think smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the world.
