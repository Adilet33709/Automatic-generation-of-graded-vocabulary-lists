Recently, the most issue of college students is tuition. Correctly, that is tuition bomb. We pay big money for tuition. Look around; there is many people who get a loan. In my opinion, college students to have a part-time job are not important. That is for condition. If you rich enough you don't have to worried about pay for tuition. But if you not, you must to be a part-time jobber. You can't afford pay for tuition, that means you are not rich, so you have to get a loan for attend the college. Then you have a dept and repay yourself. Because you are not child anymore, so can't bother your parents for repaying tuition. However there is an exception. That is a scholarship. Theoretically to receive a scholarship is easy. You can just study hard and participate the party or festival that you belong. But my experience, to receive a scholarship is very difficult to me during four years. So do I, I have been part-time job since I am 20. Therefore you cannot try to study hard, and not rich, you have no choice. You find a part-time job. So part-time job is not important everyone. That just only important to needed to one.
