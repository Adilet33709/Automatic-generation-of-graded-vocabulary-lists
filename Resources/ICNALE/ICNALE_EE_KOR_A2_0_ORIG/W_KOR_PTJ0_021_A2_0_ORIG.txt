I think part time job is very good to student. I will write about why. First, it can earn my own money. We can use that for eating, shopping or enjoy your time. And I can help my mother for my university registration fee. Second, it can help to your society experience. It will help you that how to do at your company and how to face your boss. Also you can make friends at work. I can save my money for the future and to buy my parent birthday gift if I save them monthly, not depend on my parent to be grown up. Now days university fee is very expensive too so that is why students look for part time job. Another reason is society experience many people graduate with no social experience that can be problem adjusting to the working company. To face boss it take a lot of brave mind because boss can fire you anytime. At school we have friend and work we can make friend too make friend at work can help me adopting to work and teach me how to work well. These reasons are why I agree to do part time job
