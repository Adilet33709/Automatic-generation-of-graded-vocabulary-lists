I agree that it is important for college students to have a part time job. First, college students will take a nice job after graduation, and they know that when owners need and pick the new officer, they usually want who man has many experience to other office. Students can make experience, such as visiting other countries, working somewhere, and internship. My friend worked for a long time in one company when she was college student, and then she could get a job to there. Second, they always feel that college fee is very expensive. So they need a lot of money for college life. But they can not work for a long time and every days, Because, they are student, and students have study. Finally, they learn to the value of money. Today, we live in richness of everything. If we want to hold something or want to change such as telephones, MP, and watch, we can hold that from parents or somebody. So, we don't know the value of money. I think that if college students have a part time job, they will grow great man and will change they's life, so a part time job of college students is very important.
