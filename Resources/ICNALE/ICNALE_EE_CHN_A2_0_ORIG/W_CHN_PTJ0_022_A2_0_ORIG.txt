In the last years, college students taking a part-time job become very popular in the big city. Many people believe that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. But I disagree with it. I have some reason to support my idea. Firstly, I hold that everyone should have the most important thing to be done in the different period. To be a student, study is the key word for us. If you cannot study well, you waste your time. Secondly, lots of students want to lessen their parents' financial burden through taking a part-time job. But it has a bad effect on their study. They do not know the most important thing their parents respect is that they can learn well and live a better life after they graduate. Therefore, pay much attention on your study now. The most important thing is not to have a part-time job right now, learn professional skills and practice yourself is the most serious thing in the university. If you want to earn more money, this will really help you later. So don't be influenced by others and try to keep on learning knowledge and you will succeed in the future.
