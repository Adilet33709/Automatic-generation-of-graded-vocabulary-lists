With social development, smoking forbidden takes more and more important place in building the civil society. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, because smoking is bad for health, and smoking in restaurants put bad effect to other people. Also, we need to build a more harmony society. First, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because smoking is harmful to our body, especially while smoking in a restaurant. As we all know, cigrette equals poisson. But we can't ban cigrettes, for the contribution to the economy given by the cigrette company. So what we can do is to stop smoking in restaurants to protect people from second-hand smoke. Second, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because smoking in a restaurant may annoy other people.

Last, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because we need a more harmony society. According to what has been mentioned above, smoking makes other people feel uncomfortable, physically and mentally. Therefore, it is against what we are seeking—a harmony society. In that case, to get a better image, to build the civil society, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. All in all, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, due to smoking in restaurants is harmful to our body, our mental and our society development.
