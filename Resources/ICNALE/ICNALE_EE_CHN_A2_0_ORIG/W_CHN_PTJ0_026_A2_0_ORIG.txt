I agree the opinion that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have the following reasons to explain my idea. College students need not only to learn knowledge of books, but also to practice in universities. College students have a part-time job, which are interests. College students can make their knowledge learning from books practiced by home teaching, and they can get the living experience through a part-time job. They can find out their shortcoming and advantages. A part-time job is good for college students' growth. For example, these people's achievements that also experienced the living of a university prove that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. In college age, they go through the living of a part-time job, and all respects of their abilities are raised. They become more confident of themselves and they have great powers to work. So the reasons above show explain my thought. I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. That is good for the developing of college students. So if you have a chance to have a part-time job, try to get it and work hard. You will get the advantages.
