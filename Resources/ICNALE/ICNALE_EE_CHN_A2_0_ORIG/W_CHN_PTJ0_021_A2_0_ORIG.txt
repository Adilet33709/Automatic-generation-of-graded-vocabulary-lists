I agree that it is important for college students to have apart-time job. Nowadays, a large number of college students are having a part-time job. Some of them hold that part-time jobs can help them to adapt to the society well and give them many experiences. Take a friend of mine for example, when Lily was a college student, she went to supermarket as a promoter or went to be a family teacher every weekend. Then owing to her experiences, she quickly got a good job after graduating from university. in the other students' opinions, they think that they can buy goods they want their parents cannot afford. I know a student that he goes to a restaurant as a waiter at his part-time to earn enough money what a computer needs. Thus, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. However, our parents always don't agree us to get part-time jobs. They are afraid that our study and safety. In my opinion, having a good part-time job is good for students. We should pay attention to the advantages of part-time jobs and make the most of them. Meanwhile, we should learn to get knowledge from the part-time jobs and make them a helpful tool for our development.
