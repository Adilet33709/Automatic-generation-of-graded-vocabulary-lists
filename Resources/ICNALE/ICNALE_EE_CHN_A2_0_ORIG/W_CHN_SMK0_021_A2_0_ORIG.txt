Some people hold that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. But I don't agree with this opinion. I have some reasons to support and explain my opinion. For one thing, everyone has his own hobby. No one likes others to change their hobby. Somebody likes to smoke, so we have no right to refuse them to have dinners at restaurants for this reason. For another thing, the restaurants are public places, smoking at public places is not good but we can do nothing but advising them. However, the restaurants' owners can leave a room for those smokers. When they want to smoke, they should go to that room for them. This can separate smokers from most customers and I believe more and more customers will be interested in this restaurant if you do like this. So by this way, both smokers and other customers are happy with this method in the restaurant. So it is difficult to completely ban smoking in all the restaurants in the country because we can do other things for this problem. But as we all known, smoking is an immediate threat to health; it can cause seriously cancer. So we all had better smoke less.
