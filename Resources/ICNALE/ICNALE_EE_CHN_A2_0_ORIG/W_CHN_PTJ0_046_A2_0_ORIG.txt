Nowadays, college students want to have a part-time job during their study periods. In my opinion, I think everything has two aspects like one coin has two sides. On the one hand, if you want to gain more experiences in society, to have a part-time job is a good way, but on the other hand, in case you pay more attention on your part-time job that you don't have enough times on your study lessons, for a college student, study is most important for a student. Most college students believe a part-time job can support their more job chances in the future, and it also can improve a person's confidence and responsibility. So in this way, to find a part-time job is a practical idea. There are other college students believe that college is a study place, so they consider that if we spend much time in doing a part-time job, we may delay our school works, in this aspect, concentrating our attention on studying is more important than having a part-time job in society. From now on, college becomes more and more market focus and a college student must be provided with variety of skills. To have a part-time job or not, it all depends on your personal abilities.
