Recently, there has been a discussion about whether it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are two opinions about this question. Some people think it is good to have part-time job. But some other people don't think it is good to do it. I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have some reasons. Some people are agree with this sentence. Firstly, if they have a part-time job, they can relieve their parents' burden. Besides, it also can increase their chances to practice in society. However, some people object this opinion. They claim that part-time jobs will waste student's time and affect their studying. Therefore, they just need to work hard. As far as I am concerned that students should have a part-time job on the basis of working selectively. For one thing, by working they can keep themselves well informed of as much knowledge as possible. For another, without selection, some working that everyone can do will waste our times. And we will learn less. Also it will make working ineffective because of we don't do the job which we should do. All in all, it is necessary that we should have a part-time job and have some selection.
