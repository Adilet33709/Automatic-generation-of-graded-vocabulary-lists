Absolutely I agree with the point. Restaurant is a place for people to have a nice dinner with their family. Smokes will destroy the warm atmosphere. And this also do harm to people's health. Someone may say that whether smoke depend on personal preferences, this is selfish behavior. It will make other people be unhealthy. The important thing is smoking can shorten one's life. It's very terrible. Personally, I do not like those people who smoke in public place. As is known to all, smoking just make people increase the risk of cancer. And those second-hand smokers will be more influenced than smokers. Especially in public places, smokes are extremely harmful. Smokes are poison gas. If there is no one smokes in restaurant, people will enjoy themselves more and more. The law may make smokes give up smoking so it is also benefit for them. A professor called Peter in HK university said＂one cigarette can kill at least 50 mice＂. You know, smoking just make people feel boring but no benefits. In conclusion, smoking should be banned in all restaurants and people should do this well themselves. We have an obligation to make people more health life.
