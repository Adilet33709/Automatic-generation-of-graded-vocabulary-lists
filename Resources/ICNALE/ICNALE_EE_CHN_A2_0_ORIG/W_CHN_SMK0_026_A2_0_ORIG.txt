I disagree the view that smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. My evidences are below. That smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants does not fit with the reality world. Because a lot of men smoke now, which smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants is impossible at the present. If smoking is banned in all the restaurants, many men maybe against that smoking is completely banned in the restaurants. Many men who smoke think that it is not reasonable to ban smoking in all the restaurants. And those smokers will not go to restaurants will bring trouble to the restaurants. They will have business problem. If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants, it is harm for the interests of the restaurants. All the restaurants will give way to men's attitudes. Although smoking is not good for health of people's, men don't want to give up smoking. They say that smoking help them many ways. Some say that they fell happier by smoking and forget troubles by smoking. All the restaurants will allow men to smoking, for all the restaurants want to get more interests. I think maybe we can do other something to solve smoking problem in the restaurants but not completely ban smoking in the restaurants in the country right now.
