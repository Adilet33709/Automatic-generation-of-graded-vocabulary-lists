With the more and more college students have a part-time job; most of people have a question: It is important for college students to have a part-time job? In my opinion, college students to have a part-time job are not necessary. I can list some reasons to explain my opinion. The first, although the study of college is relaxing, but it's also need to study hard. For student, every second is important. If we have time to do part-time job, why not spend these time to study knowledge?The second, most of college students don't have much social experience, they are cheated very easily. And they don't have ability to keep themselves out of danger. I think the school is very safe, if the students go out to work, I can't imagine what danger they will face with. The last but also important, nobody can guarantee the part-time job will give students too much value experience. But on the other hand, it's very well for students to join the school club activity. They can chat with each other who are also students; they can spare happiness with each other's a very good thing. All above, the part-time job is dangerous and unnecessary for college students. Maybe students are curious about it, they want to try it. But I think the knowledge of book is also interesting.
