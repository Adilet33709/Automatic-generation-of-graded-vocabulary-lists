Nowadays, it is generally accepted that smoking is becoming more and more of a problem in our country. This phenomenon brings great damage especially smoking in the restaurants. So someone think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. And someone doesn't think so. I prefer to the former one because I have some reasons below. There are many reasons accounting for my idea. On the one hand, smoking in the restaurant will damage their health and also other people's health. Most people know that smoking is harmful and can lead to many terrible diseases. It is not fair for people not smoke to get diseases because they sit together with smokers in the restaurants. So we must insist it. On the other hand, it will damage the environment. All the people want to eat in a clean restaurant. The unclean environment will make people unhappy and make the bad effect of you in the restaurants. So people will not like the restaurants if there are many smoking inside. Clearly, if we are blind to this problem, it is very likely that the restaurant will receive more and more complaints about smoking. We must pay attention to this problem.
