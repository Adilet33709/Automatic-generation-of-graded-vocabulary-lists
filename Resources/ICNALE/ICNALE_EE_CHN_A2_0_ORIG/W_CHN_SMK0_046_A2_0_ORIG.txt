There is a hot discussion about banning smoking in the restaurants. I agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country. I used to ask some persons why you want to smoke. They answered that there are many reasons for it. First guy said his work and family that gave him much stress, and smoking seemed to be the only way for him to release the pressure. Otherwise, smoking has been such as his best friend and he could tell it everything what he want to say. Second guy also had the same reasons that like the first people. In addition, he thought if he could smoke a good cigarette, it seemed to be that he was a rich man as well. So I thought smoking was a way to show one's riches. Through the analysis, I think smoking at all the restaurant is nothing but harm. There are three reasons to support my ideas. First, smoking usually is bad for our health, and if he or she is smoking at the restaurant, the smoke will spread out all over the restaurant, and other people also will be smoked. Second, through a good cigarette to show off one's riches is not a good social mode, we should ban this bad social mode together and encourage people not to smoke at the restaurant anymore. Third, restaurant is only a place where some people can eat food or chat with others, if you are smoking at the restaurant, you may affect other people to eat food happily. To sum up, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
