 I do not agree with this point. Maybe some people think that taking a part-time job can help themselves in many respects—explore the knowledge outside the books and even gain the financial independence. Three are still other students who think that part—time jobs will have strong negative influence on study. And the work, which often makes a student under strong pressure and burden. And this will make students join fewer college activities. In my opinion, I think students should pay more attention to study than part—time jobs. And part—time job is a small cheese for students. For college students, time is very limited and valued. If students spend their limited time on part—time jobs, there is no doubt that they have less time to study. So they have little time for their college activities. If someone think part—time job will give them extra earning, I am certainly against it. College time is not a proper period to earn for students. It is a best time to learn varied knowledge. In case they gain some money now, they will lose a lot of money in future. To summa up, college students should not take part—time jobs when they study in college. Part—time jobs just make student lose their ways in heart. For students school work is more important than part—time job. Knowledge is power.
