In recent years, many people are talking about whether or not to ban smoking in restaurants. As far as I'm concerned, smoking should be banned in all the public places including restaurants, because it has a bad influence on the health of people. On the one hand, smoking make many people get disease. We know from books that smoking harm people smoke and all the people sit around them. In some magazines, some scientists say that second-hand smoke is more dangerous sometimes. Many people die because smoke second-hand smoke. In the restaurants, people smoke is harming people have meals in the same place and at the same time. On the other hand, smoking makes the air in the restaurants terrible. In our country, many times I have meals in a restaurant and someone sit close to me smoke. It makes feel uncomfortable but I don't know what to do. I am sure that smoking is harmful to everyone. There is no denying that if smoking is banned in all the public places like restaurants most of us will breathe in more fresh and clean air and have a happy dinner. So we will not worry about smoke in the restaurants any longer.
