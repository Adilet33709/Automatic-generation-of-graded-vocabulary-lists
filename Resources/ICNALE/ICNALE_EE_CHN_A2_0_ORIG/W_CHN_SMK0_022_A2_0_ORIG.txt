For many years, smoking is a hot topic for the people all over the world. People always say that smoking is harm to our health and we should reduce the population of smoking. But should smoking be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country? My answer to this question is yes. On the one hand, smoking does no good than harm to our health and restaurant is a place of eating. People eat and drink in the restaurant, if one people in the restaurant smoking, it will pollute the whole air of restaurant. Those people around the smokers will not have good mood to have their dinner any longer. Some scientists say that second-hand smoke is more dangerous in many examples. We know people in the restaurants all want to be healthy. On the other hand, smoking in the restaurant may catch the fire easily and it is dangerous for us to have a meal in the dangerous place. I read some news in newspapers that some restaurants got fire because smokers threw cigarettes after smoking into some places in the restaurants. So, because the reasons above, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Let us keep a healthy environment in our eating place.
