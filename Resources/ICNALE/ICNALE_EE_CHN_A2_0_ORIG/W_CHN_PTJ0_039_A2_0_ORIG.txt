I believe that it is important for college student to have a part-time job. While we are growing up, we can look after ourselves. It was our mothers take to the beautiful world. They taught us to walk, to speak and so on. Now, it our turn to care for our parents. So part-time job may be a good choice. And we work for our boss so that we get enough money. In addition, we rich our experience which can only be get from the real work environment. On the other hand, we shouldn't take much our attention on it because we now are just student not workers. And if we haven't known enough fundament acknowledge, we can't do well in our part-time job. Do not forget that the study can help the work while the work can help the study. To obtain much acknowledges is the main mission of our collage student. How balance the study and the work is the challenge for our freshmen. So the plan is most important. Having a part-time job in summer or winter vocation is a great idea. And we have been adults. We could make own schedule. A part-time job is an important part of our college student's life!
