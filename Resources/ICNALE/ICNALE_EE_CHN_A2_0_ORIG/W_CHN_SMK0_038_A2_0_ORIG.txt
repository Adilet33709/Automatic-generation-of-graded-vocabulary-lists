Generally speaking, I don't agree with the idea of topic B, which smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Now, I like to talk about my opinions: To begin with, it is a right for people to smoking in the restaurant. Restaurants are public place for all customers, so everyone has no qualification to limit it. What's more, people should observe the law, and cannot do the thing what they want to do. In the next place, we can build a smoking room, for those people who are already addicted to smoke. In this way, protect smokers' personal right. And when smokers eat in the restaurants, they will not disturb other customers. Then, the quantity of cigarette sold will be decrease, thus it will affect the economy of society immediately. On the other hand, The last point, this ban will not only arise smokers' negative mood, but also lead to social trend. Some smokers think that smoking can help them solve difficult problems and relax their thought. In the end, to draw a conclusion above, I strongly believe that smoking shouldn't be banned at all the restaurants in the country. We can take some other ways to solve the problem of smoking in the restaurants.
