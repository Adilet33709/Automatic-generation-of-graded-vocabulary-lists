In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. I have some reasons to support my idea. Smoking is an unhealthy habit. Because it contains the fired soil and something that can causes the cancer. And it also destroys their bodies. Those smokers usually have some diseases. Having smoked for a long time means that they are killing themselves day by day. And what is more, it is obvious that the people who eat with them breathe the same polluted air which leading eaters have no interested in what they taste. Also the smoke is harmful to their health too. If the law of banning is through, the atmosphere of restaurants will be more perfect. And the good smell of the delicious food but nothing else is full of the whole room. The more fresh air they breathe and the less smoke they take, the longer life they will have. The cleaning of public places not only the restaurant should be kept. So they including the dining room should be completely avoided from the smoking. If all the restaurants clean, I believe more people will benefit. So all in all, government should do something to ban smoking in all the restaurants in the country now.
