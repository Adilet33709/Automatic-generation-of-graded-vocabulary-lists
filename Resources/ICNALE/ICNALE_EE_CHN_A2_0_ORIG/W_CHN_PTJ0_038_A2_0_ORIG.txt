Today, more and more college students are taking part-time jobs. It told us different people hold different viewpoints. Some people agree with the idea of topic A, which part-time job is very good for college students. In my opinion, it is not so important for college students to have part-time jobs. I have some reasons to prove my point. Some people think there are some advantages if students take part-time jobs. They think that many students gain experience from part-time job. Some people even say they can have practice some good characters. On the other hand, students can earn money from doing part-time jobs. If they are from very poor family, they can reduce their family burden. But after-school work has brought a lot of problems. For example, some students all the time think of their part-time jobs and cannot decide study is more important now. So some students now have some problems with study and some even don't go to class on time. As for me, I think the main task of students is to study hard and learn important knowledge. They can earn money later. So college students now need to know what are more important is study.
