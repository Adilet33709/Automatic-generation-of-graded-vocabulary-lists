Recently, some people argue that the current education system cannot equip the students with practical skills on working and just emphasizes the importance of the academic result. They suggest that university students have a part time job and this can improve the ability of problem solving. However, other may argue that taking part time job may affect the academic result of students. I think that the benefit of taking part time job outweighs its drawback. Firstly, taking part time job can give students with chances to learn more about team working as they may need to finish a proposal with other people. Most jobs such as sales manager involve team work and they need to operate each other well no matter what position of company. Also, their communication skills may improve as they need to talk with foreign people. Taking part time job is helpful for personal development of students. First, they can know their interest, weakness or strength if they try different part time jobs. Then, this can build up student's confidence as well as develop their own potential. Some people may argue that taking part time job affects the academic result of students. They even point out that some students may lose concentration during lesson and even may be absence in some lessons. In fact, such problem cannot exist if students can allocate time well. This also gives chance for student to learn how to manage time well.
