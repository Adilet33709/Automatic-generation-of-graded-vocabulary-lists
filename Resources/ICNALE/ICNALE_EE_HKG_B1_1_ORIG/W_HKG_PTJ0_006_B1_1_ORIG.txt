Is earning money and experience important for us? For university students, I think every of them should have to find a part-time job. It is not only for the money but also for the future. First of all, for every university student, they have to play $42100 for every year. It is such a big deal for a lower-income family. Having a part-time job can help to alleviate the family's burden. For me, I come from a family which is poor. It is hard for my family to pay the money involved. Although the salary of part-time job is not enough high, there is no doubt that it can help for the total amount. Secondly, a university graduate cannot fit all the requirements that the employers need. We can learn experiences during the part-time job such as communication skills through us and the clients or other useful skills. This is a prerequisite for getting a good-pay job and it just makes the life happier. To conclude, having a part-time job has a lots of benefits, it is highly recommended to do it. Just find a job now!
