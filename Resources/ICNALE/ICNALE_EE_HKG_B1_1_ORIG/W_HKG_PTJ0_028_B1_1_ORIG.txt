I think it is important for part of students to have a part-time job, but not all students need a part-time job. It's true that part-time job can practice our ability but it also cost a lot of time. Does part-time job benefit university students? It depends on how much you learn and how much you pay. For business school students, it's very important to have a part-time job because they really need internship to gain practical experience. When business school students graduate, they will not sit in the labs or classrooms. Business school students aim to earn money and they need real experience not only the knowledge on textbooks. Besides study, they have lots of spare time and the best way to use the time is to do a part time job rather than play computer games all day. But for science school students, it may be not so significant to have a part-time job. Science school students spend most of their time in lab or library. The most important thing for them is to gain the lab skill and knowledge from core courses, so they don't have to pay much attention to a part-time job.
