Personally, I think it is important for university students to have a part-time job because of the following reasons. First of all, since graduation from high school, most of the parents will stop giving their sons/daughters money. University students need to earn money in order to maintain their daily spending. So getting a part-time job is exactly the way to solve this problem. Secondly, most of the university students will buy a lot of things like Iphone, Macbook, cell phone, clothings, etc. Those products are quite expensive to them, if they want to keep buying those luxury goods, they must work during their spare time so as to earn more and save as much as possible before it is getting sufficient to buy a product. Thirdly, having a part-time job is a way to use the time wisely for university students. For example, they may have some day-offs every week as there are no lessons on that day, then it is quite common that they want to have something to do rather than staying at home on that day. So they will think of working part-time which it a way that can earn money and spend their spare time in a meaningful way. In conclusion, it is important for university students to have a part-time job simply because of economic concern.
