Nowadays, it is not uncommon to see university students doing part-time jobs. And I don't think it is important for students to have a part time job because of several reasons. Pursuant to a research done by The Chinese University of Hong Kongs, university students who take part-time jobs have shown a decline in their studies as they are often distracted away by their jobs, some may even make truant a habit since they are tired after working. Also, some may argue that students who have part-time jobs can earn money by their own, thus can become financially independent and help to relieve financial burdens of their families. But it is not the case. As many student who have part-time jobs seldom pay the tuition fees by themselves, they would rather use their money earned to buy luxury and pricely products which their parents can hardly afford. So, their parents still need to pay for their tuition fees and give them pocket money. This will make students becoming more and more materialism and brand-addicted. Lastly, students may become demotivated in studying. When they have a part-time job, their timetable will be so tight that don't even have time to hang out with friends, and they will be eventually disconnected with their friends and feel isolated. Hence, they may lose motivation to study as they are not happy wth their school and social lives. Therefore, I don't think it is important for university students to have part-time jobs.
