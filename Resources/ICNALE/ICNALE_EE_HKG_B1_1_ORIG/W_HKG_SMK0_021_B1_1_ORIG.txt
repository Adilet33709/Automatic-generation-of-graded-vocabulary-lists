From my point of view, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. There are some reasons behind this. Firstly, everyone knows that smoking endangers our life, every year there are lots of people died which are directly or indirectly related to smoking, form the viewpoint of health, it is obvious that banning smoking in every place could effectively reduce the chance of people inhale first-hand or second-hand cigarette which is hazardous to their body. Since most of the restaurants still have smoking area available, it is still possible for customers/workers there who will inhale those harmful gases. Therefore all the restaurants should ban smoking, if they want to attract more people who don't want to take anymore second-hand cigarette. Secondly, it will bring customers bad impression if they find they smell lots of smoke in the restaurant. Then they will have a bad image to that restaurant and stop going to that restaurant anymore, it will affect the reputation of the restaurant and the income of the restaurant will dramatically decrease. So it is always better for the restaurant to ban smoking if they want a better profit. In conclusion, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants because of the profit and the health of all people.
