Recently, banning smoking at all restaurants becomes a hot topic of discussion. Government also implants the law to ban smoking in public area. The supporter points out that banning smoking in restaurants can improve air quality of restaurants as well as health of workers and customers of restaurants. Other people such as restaurant owners argue that this can cause loss in term of profit. As a whole, the benefit of banning smoking in all restaurants outweighs its drawback. Firstly, banning smoking can improve the air quality of restaurants as this reduces the release of second hand smoke from smokers which contains harmful substances such as tar and nicotine which is harmful for non-smokers and workers of restaurants. Customers still inhale second hand smoke when sitting at non-smoking area due to the air-conditioner system of restaurant. Passive smoking can even greater harm to health of non-smokers than active smoking. That explains why smoking should be banned in all restaurants. Some people argue that some smokers may not go to restaurants after banning smoking and result in the loss of profit. They also add that some restaurants such as discos and bars as most customers at such places are smokers. However banning smoking of restaurants can improve the image of restaurants and increasing no. of non-smoking customers compensate the reduction in no. of smoking customers. Passive smoking in bars and discos still cause harm to their workers.
