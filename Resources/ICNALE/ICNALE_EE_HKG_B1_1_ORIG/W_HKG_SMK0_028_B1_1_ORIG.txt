I think smoking shouldn't be banned at all restaurants because different customs have different requirement. We all know smoking is bad for people themselves and can affect their neighbors' health though the second-hand smoke, so most restaurants should ban smoking to protect customs' health. This also makes our city clean and healthy. But should all restaurants do so? I don't think so because it's too strict and doesn't respect all people's right. Some customs they just want to go to somewhere that can smoke and we assume people who go to these restaurants accept smoking. Many people have a habit of smoking and they need cigarettes to make them calm especially for business man when they talk about some business on dinner. We know that many successful businessmen like smoking and smoking make them handle things better. Many people just enjoy smoking and their friends may also like it. The best way for them to have entertainment may be having a lunch with cigarettes and a restaurant that allows smoking is their best choice. It's better for them to smoke in a restaurant rather than in other public environment. Limit smoking in a small space is better than making it spread out.
