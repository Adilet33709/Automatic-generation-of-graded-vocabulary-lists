Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. It is proved for many years that cigarette smokes do harm our health, especially the second hand smoke. Every one has the right to be healthy and stay away from the harm of smoke. One may argue that smokers also have the right to smoke. However, banning smoking in restaurant does no affect to their right. There are many open areas for them to smoke while in restaurant, with the closed environment and long time staying, the non-smokers have no way to escape from the smoke. Therefore this policies benefits non-smokers while does not affect the smokers at all. Also, we have to argue that this policy must be applied to all restaurant in stead of some. From time to time, there had been a long discussion about this issue. While that period, some restaurants decided to prohibit smoking but soon they lost a large portion of smoker customers. Some gradually gave up and stop others from being a no-smoke restaurant. As a result, a no smoking environment was hardly achieved for many years. Until that laws are passed to prohibit smoking in all public indoor areas, this situation was totally changed. Since smokers find no substitute, they have to give up smoking in restaurant. Under this fair condition, restaurants do not lost their customers at all. Finally, banning smoking in restaurant may increase the difficulty for smoking. Some smokers may consider giving up smoking. This is another advantage that we could think of for sure. Therefore, all reasons support that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants.
