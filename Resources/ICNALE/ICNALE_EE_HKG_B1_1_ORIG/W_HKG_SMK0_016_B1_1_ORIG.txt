It is well-known that Smoking is a bad habit which is harmful to your health and appearance. Government has already set up lots of law to prevent the next generation from Smoking, like risen the cigarette taxes and prohibit teens under 18 to buy cigarette. Frankly speaking, it is the right time to secure non-smoker from inhaling the smoke released by burning cigarette from public areas. Try to imagine, how is your feeling if someone smoke when you're having the wonderful meal with your lover in the restaurant? I think the smoker should respect others in public areas especially restaurant. If smoking has not completely banned in the restaurant, it would absolutely affect different kinds of people. For customers, apart from the health problem and mood, the smoke will also decrease the appetite, as a consequence many dishes or food maybe discard. For the case of the restaurant holder, their revenue may greatly reduce due to the loss of non-smoking customers. Even the smoker himself, there would be a great chance for the cigarette ash to disperse on the food surface, this is extremely dangerous as the cigarette ashes contain many toxic substances such as tar or sulphur derivatives. As a result, I totally support the government should ban Smoking in all restaurant.
