I strongly agree with the contention that it is important for university students to have a part-time job, for two reasons. Firstly, students can acquire knowledge. Secondly, part-time job is a good start for career preparation. By doing a part-time job, university students acquire the living skills that will never be gained within class. In class, what students have learnt so far are all the theoretical knowledge and concepts such as mathematical equations in Physics or grammar usage in English writing. The university students have gained enough academic knowledge; however, they know little about the living skills which is extremely for them to make a living. Having a part-time job, the students have the chance to be exposed to the practical society and from the experience so that they will get the living skills accordingly. For example, being a coordinator of public relationship, a student will gain the art of communicating with different kinds of people properly. Having a part-time job is beneficial for career preparation. In the short term of view, students have an invaluable opportunity to put their book knowledge into practical use. The knowledge gained in class is taught to be used by the students towards their future career. There is an old saying that practice makes perfect. Applying the knowledge into practical use, the student will have a deeper understanding of what he had learnt. In the long term of view, the experience of doing a part-time job is a helpful evidence of a student's capability for the future applications of jobs. As demonstrated above that the acquisition of living skills and knowledge is guaranteed by having a part-time job, a student, who has working experience, is more apt to get hired because a company is more willing to hire those who are more experienced. Due to the two reasons above, the significance of having a part-time job for a university student is quite clear.
