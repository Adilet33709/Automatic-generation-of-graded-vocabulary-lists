Did you ever have lunch in a restaurant with smoke? It is definitely smelly and harmful for all the human-beings. Then, would it have to be banned in all the restaurant? That is a good question we have to discuss. Some who agree to ban smoking said they will be harmed by those smoke. And it would cause a number of diseases such as heart diseases or lung cancer. As we all know, everyone does not want to get sick. Banning smoking in restaurant can make the air becomes fresh, everyone here is more likely to dine there. However, those who disagree with the ban are that it is not fair to them. Some of the restaurants have separate into two areas-smoking area and non-smoking area. Those who don't want to smoke can go to the non-smoking area and just dine there. Some restaurants even just banned all the smoking events. Different people can go to their area whatever they want. It is no contradiction. To conclude, although there still exists a controversy, we all know that smoking is harmful for all people. Just take it away as soon as possible.
