It has been lots of controversy about whether a University student should concentrated in academic or to have a part-time job for some income or gain experience. For my opinion, they are both extremely essential for our future career and hence that's why I always support students to do some part-time job before graduation. According to the survey, many employers in HK point out the main problem of fresh-graduate are they lack with the working experience and communication skill with stranger or client. The merits mentioned above could be developed by having some part time job'effectively'. It is well known that the University has already set up a platform to provide many resources for student, like the summer internship at HK or oversea. So that student should treasure their valuable time in summer break and winter break to equip their own for future. However, I definitely discourage students to do part time job during the studying period, it should be noticed that the first priority for them is to seek for the knowledge but not wasting most of their time to gain a limited amount of money, especially those wasted their salary on the meaningless entertainment! Apart from studying and working, student should also widen their social networking in University by participate the extra curriculum activities. Work hard, Play hard!
