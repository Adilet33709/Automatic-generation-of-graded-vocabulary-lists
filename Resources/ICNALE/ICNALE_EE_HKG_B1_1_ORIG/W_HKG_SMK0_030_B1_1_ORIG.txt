When we are eating in a restaurant, we may see people smoking. If we are not smokers, we will feel uncomfortable since we will breathe in the smoke, so smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. Smoking do harm to people's health. Researches have shown that smoking not only threatens the smokers, but also do harm to people around the smokers. When I go to restaurants with a friend of mine, a heavy smoker, I will have a sore throat. He smokes a lot in the restaurant, since the restaurant doesn't ban smoking. It is unfair for non-smoking people to be affected by smoking when they go to restaurants. There are usually some children in the restaurants. If smoking is not banned, these children will be affected by the smoke given out from the cigarettes since children are more venerable. Restaurants are places for having food, not smoking. It is disgusting for non-smoking customers to smell the smoke when they are enjoying their food. Smoking may cause fire in the restaurants if the cigarette stubs are thrown on the cloth on the table, which threatens customers' lives. Smokers can smoke somewhere outside the restaurant, but not in the restaurants, because restaurants are not suitable place for smoking. Customers are willing to have a comfortable and safe place to enjoy their food, and smoking is not suitable in the restaurant. Therefore, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants.
