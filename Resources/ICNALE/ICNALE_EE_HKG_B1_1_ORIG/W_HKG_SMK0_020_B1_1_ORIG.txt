From my perspective, smoking ought to be completely banned at all restaurants because of its harm to the others particularly in air transmission and food pollution. Admittedly, for most of the smokers, it would be certainly enjoyable for the smoker himself to smoke when they are having a meal, but smoking would be a catastrophe towards the others at the same restaurant. Numerous researches have already proved that the smoke will do three times harm to the victim who absorbs the smoke from the cigarettes. Being a kind of public place, the restaurant is such an open space that once a smoker smokes, the rest of the costumers will be affected. As a result, it's obvious that smoking at restaurants will do harm to the others. For the seek of protecting the health of all the costumers, we should ban smoking at all restaurants. Besides the harm of the smoke, the the negative effect of smoking by polluting the food is something that we should also concern. Apart from its harm to lung which is a well known fact already, smoking hurts the smokers' stomach as well when they are eating at the same time. During the meal time, if the smoker smokes, the ash of the cigarette will drop into the food, which will eventually go into both the smoker's and the nearby people's stomach. The stomach of human being is unable to digest the ash of the cigarette, as a result, the stomach gets severe hurt due to the smoking. To sum up, as we have seen the ad effect of smoking at restaurants already, it is a must to ban smoking at all the restaurants.
