Whether smoking ban at all restaurant was a controversial issue in the territory. There are both pros and cons of this policy. For me, I am on of the advocators. In this essay, I would like to air my view on the benefits of the issue. To start with, implementing smoking ban can improve the working condition of the catering service workers. reducing the exposed time to the second-hand smoke of the waiters and waitresses. That's to say. the smoking ban can help protect the health of the workers, lowering the chance of suffering from respirstory diseases and even lung cancer. What's more, the health of the general public can also be safeguarded. This is very dangerous that the non-smokers always have to suffer from the second-hand smoke of the smoking caters, especially for pregnant women and small children because their immunity is weaker. Thus, while the smoking ban is put into force, their health can also be protected. More importantly, the policy can improve the reputation of Hong Kong as a clean city. With less people smoking in Hong Kong, the air quality in Hong Kong will certainly become better. Therefore, Hong Kong will become a more attractive city for the tourists. As a result, the general image of Hong Kong as an international and healthy city will be further promoted. Conclusively speaking, there are many benefits of the policy. By prohibiting smoking at all restaurant, I am convinced our citizens' health and city's image can be improved.
