The mission of university is to train students to be independent and all rounded intelligence. Under this presuppose, one should not neglect the training and experience given by part time job. Having a part time job helps students learn to manage their time well and be responsible for their own duty. Some part time in particular matches with their own field of study may also enhance their chance of learning and apply what they learn in classes. However, one should not say that part time job is an obligation. As part of the university students are supposed to be future scholars and professors in their own field, they need to focus more on their academic work. Say for example, a professional scientist, mathematician, historian or sociologist need not gain working experience. It is easy to see that professors and scholars need more advance skills like critical thinking, methodology and modeling to explain phenomenon. On the other hand, part time job trains practical skills like documentary work or even labor work. These skills have clearly no relation to their future research. One could gain nothing from doing a part time job but lost time for their further study and research. For them, part time job is just an obstacle to their success. University education is supposed to be free and student oriented. If a student want to have their career in practical fields or industry, they may have part time job to gain experience. If a student has already decided to continue to study and live with knowledge and research, part time job means nothing to them. Therefore, the importance of part time job depends on one's ambition. It could not be regarded as'important' but just'useful'.
