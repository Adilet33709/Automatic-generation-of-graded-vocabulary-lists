It is well known that people going to some restaurant or bar have a right to look forward to a good time-spending and pleasant meal. Unfortunately, all their expectations are often being spoiled by the odour of smoke. More and more countries decide to ban smoking in all public places including restaurants and coffee shops. Despite of all evidences that smoking causes lung cancer and other severe conditions, there is still a lot of smoking citizens in our society. Should the government prohibit all these people from smoking in public places? In my opinion it should certainly do this. First and foremost, as we know smoking in crowded places is harmful not only to person who carries cigarette. All people standing around that person breathe in contaminant smoke. When one individual decides to light up the cigarette, everyone around him has to breathe in nicotine from the air. Secondly, it is strongly uncomfortable for non-smoking people to get into a bar or restaurant where cigarette smoke wafts. For instance, when family with children wants to eat out, they usually look for a place for non-smokers in order not to let children have a contact with unhealthy smoke. Finally, if smoking was banned, there would be fewer smokers on our streets. So when this prohibition was imposed, perception of people would certainly change. To sum up, banning it from public places will bring about only advantages.
