He had taken on a job while in college. It also goes along way by helping the student have a practical work of what he/she is being taught in school. It also gets us equipped with new knowledge of professional ethics and code of conduct at our working place having a part time job during your college life would also be an experience that may come in handy later in life. A part-time job can help you pay for living expenses, including housing, food, books, gas, and clothes. Since you will eventually have to pay off any school-related loans that you take out, it is best to take out as little as possible. Lastly, it is always good to have money. While money may not be the most important thing in life, it does buy things such as food, heat and a roof. It buys things like college degrees (brains are needed for those too) but overall money is a pretty important thing to have and I would definitely say that those without a job are lacking money and are lacking in responsibility. All college students should attempt to get a job while in college and they should earn their own money to support themselves.
