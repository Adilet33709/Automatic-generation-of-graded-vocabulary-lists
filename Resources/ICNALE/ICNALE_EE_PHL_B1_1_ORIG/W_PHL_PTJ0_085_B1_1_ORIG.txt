Yes it is. Part time job is not only for those students who have financial problems, but also for those students that wants to have their own money for their needs or to have experience. We, as a student we need to know that our parents are working hard for us to finish our studies and we will realize that we need to study hard because working is harder than we thought. It will also help us to be responsible, be confident in our self. We can also improve our communication skill, be flexible, and how to balance our time with the help of this we so called part time job. Jobs make our lives more interesting. It will help us to train ourselves to earn money and to know that it is not an easy thing to earn money. And we should spend our money carefully. And for us to know the hard work of our parents, for us to realize that working is hard so that we should study well and do our part as a student and as a daughter/son. Many people think that having a part time job may affect our study, but I really think that having the part time job can help our future to become much better.
