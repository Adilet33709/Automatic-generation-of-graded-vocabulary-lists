As a college student, I think having a job or part time job is difficult while you are studying. If you have a job at the same time you are studying, it's like cutting your body into half meaning you have two attention and focus, works, task and etc. Being a working student, your time became smaller; your focus in some things is losing. I didn't say that don't be a working students I only say that having a work at the same time studying is difficult so I salute those working students. There are a disadvantages and advantages of being a working student. One disadvantage, like what I said earlier that your time become smaller. One advantage is you help yourself in terms of study at the same time your helping your family. A working student is so challenging because you need to balance time. It is just a matter of time management and discipline. It is just a matter of multiplying my time rather than dividing it. For me, if you are a working student just enjoy everything because every moment is a learning and a remarkable experience. It is such an experience to not only be hearing from others the way working students are, but to be actually listening and being with one in our daily work.
