Having a part time job as a college student is important because it serves as a training for us even though we need to balance our study and work. I think that being a college student, if we want to buy something we really want, we should earn money by ourselves, not using the money of our parents. Using our own money, we will not feel guilty anymore. Having a part time job, we will have the working experience and have the chance to adapt the different relationship between classmates and colleagues earlier than the people who do not have the part time job. Having the working experience can help us as a college students to find the ideal job more easily in the future. And we can also learn how to deal with the problems that may happen in our future working circumstance. We as a college students, we can also expand our interpersonal relationship by having a part time job. In the recent year, interpersonal relationship has become the most important factor in our working environment. If we have a good relationship with our colleagues or friends, when we have problems or want other people to help us, they will try their best to help us. I have read an article; it said, Without friends, we will not do anything perfectly. I have the same thought that Interpersonal relationship is really important in our daily life. Many people will think that having a part time job may affect our study, but I really think that having the part time job can help us as a college students in the future to become much better, no matter in the attitude toward money, in getting working experiences, or in interpersonal relationship.
