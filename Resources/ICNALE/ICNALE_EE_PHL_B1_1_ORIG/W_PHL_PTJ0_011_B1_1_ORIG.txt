I think it depends to the situation. As a student it's hard for me to have a part time job because I can't concentrate to my studies and when you have a part time job you should know how to balance your time you should have time management. While the importance of part time job is you have benefits like you can help your family, and in terms you have a project you can buy it without regrets on where you can get the money. And you can also gain new experience and knowledge on working. You find opportunities for a range of career interests. Also you can transform what you've learned in class into practice. You can learn also how to cooperate with others and deal with different things. And the happy thing that a part time job does is you can help your family in terms of money. But a sad thing about having a part time job is you don't have much time to go out with your loved ones. Part time job is good if you have the good time management and you have or you can manage it well. But if you can't, try to manage your time properly to be able to try to have a part time Job.
