Nowadays, many things had changed a lot. There are things which fade but new things may emerge. New-hightech release gadgets are always invented in our society. Maybe, there are lots of good things that had changed the society but some of it is very disgraceful. The never-ending graft and corruption problem and economic crisis which lead the suffering of innocent people- families, children and even students are affected of it. Let's take a look to students, due to poverty some goes to school and some do not. So it is important for college students to have a part-time job not only to help oneself but also to the parents who work hard. Maybe some college students don't want it thinking that it would be hard for them to have a job and at the same time they go to school. But actually as a college student it would be better if the majority of students want to try and to have it. First, it could help financially. Second, you'll be able to help parents in providing needs while they can't even small amount. Lastly, you will become a good role model of students in a way that they can see you and recognized you as a responsible person. Having a part-time job is not a disgrace and it is not a form to down a student. Well for me, part-time job supposedly is not intended to students who can't afford much money but it would be to have it also by the students who has in life not only to teach them that money are not just just but to make it realized that be responsible enough to study hard and be wise to spend the money in a useful way.
