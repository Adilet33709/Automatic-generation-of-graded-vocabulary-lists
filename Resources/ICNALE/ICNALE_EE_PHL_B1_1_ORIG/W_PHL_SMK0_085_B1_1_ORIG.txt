Yes it should be because restaurant is an establishment were people who wants to eat not for smoking. Smoking should be banned not only in restaurant but I think in all public places. It's almost the same to those people who do not smoke because if they go out to restaurant they would be able to smell the smoke coming from smokers. Smoking is dangerous to our health, it can give us many kinds of illnesses that can affect our body and will cause death. And because of smoking, many innocent people who are not smoking will be affected and I think second smoker is more bad than the person who is smoking. And now, I think there was already a law states that if you're caught smoking in public places, someone will arrest you and pay for the penalty. And I think if we're going to collect the money that they will be going to buy for a piece of cigarette we will collect more money and we should donate it instead of smoking. In that way, our health is not in danger and most of all, it will help other people for the small amount that you will be going to donate.
