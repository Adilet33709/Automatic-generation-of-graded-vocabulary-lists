Smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country. In this statement there is a part of me that agrees and a part that do not agree. I agree because as an individual who do not smoke it is very annoying to me to smell and inhale the smoke coming from cigarettes, and in the king of restaurants we have in our country the smell of the smoke will last because it is fully air-conditioned, but on the other hand, It is not exactly that I do not agree it is just that there is no law that says smoking is banned in restaurants, and somehow a lot of people do smoke for relaxation and/or for metabolism, others smoke because they just can't resist that it is there hobby or there daily routine, but I always think on how they can continue smoking while seeing others hardly to breathe when they inhale smoke coming to those who take cigarettes. Every should be concern with one another and maybe one of the best solution in this is to be responsible in smoking in restaurants or in any public place to decrease the number of those who have lung cancer and the risk of those who have asthma, last is to decrease the polution in the air. But the best solution is to quit it and have another good hobby and to live a healthy life.
