For me it is up to the student if he/she wants to have a part time job as long as his/her priority is studying and learning, because a part time job can help to finish your studies even without the help of your parents it can also helped you to become more responsible in balancing your time with your study and your job. This will also help to build your priorities in life and focues to your goal. But some of my friends stopped studying and started to work on full time employee, because they enjoyed the not so high salary they received every month. They just kept saying this What is the purpose of studying if I already earn money for myself. they said those words without realizing that eduacational background is one of the requirements to have a good and maybe to be promoted if your part time job is related to your course taking. The point is you should be flexible, open-minded and focus on what is your main goal in life so that the chance of making it is very high. Lastly and i think the most important thing is the inspiration like a family member, a friend, a special someone or your dream that persue you to continue achieving your goal
