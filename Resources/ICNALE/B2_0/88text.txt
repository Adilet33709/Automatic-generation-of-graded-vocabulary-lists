A part-time job is a way to look for my future job. We can also experience many jobs through part-time jobs. It is very important to experience other jobs because we don't know that what we are interested in and what we want to be. For these reasons, I think it is a very good way to gain experience. I have had several part-time jobs. They were very hard experiences, but it was a great time for me. When I needed money I sold clothes last year. I worked in a department store. It was very hard and I really wanted quit right away, but I needed money to travel abroad so I couldn't do that. When I was 21, I worked at a theater. It was a very interesting time, but I stressed about money. Because I checked money and calculated money accurately, the theater earned money. I also worked at a buffet restaurant. The work was very hard but eating delicious food was very good. Sometimes people gave me tips, so I thought it was a cool job. A few months ago, I taught middle school students. It was hard work too, because middle school students did not listen to my lessons. I think that the many jobs that I have experienced are going to be good sources in my future. Someday, you can experience many part-time jobs too.
