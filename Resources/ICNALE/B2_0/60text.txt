Should smoking be banned at all the restaurants? About this ban, different people hold different views. Some people agree and some people don't agree with it. In my opinion, I agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants. There are a large number of smokers. Many people have the habit of smoking. What's more, some of them are addicted to it. They can't live without it, so they will smoke in public places such as restaurants. However, nonsmokers hate it; they hate to smell the smoke. They even complain that they are inhaling second-hand smoke in restaurants, which would do great harm to their health. Therefore, smoking is really harmful to people in restaurants. It will also affect people's appetite. I hate those who smoke in the restaurant. Firstly, it does harm to everyone. Secondly, I think it is an irresponsible behavior. Last but not least, it can pollute the clean air. Nowadays, more and more people have come to know that smoking is bad for people's health. It can lead to lung cancer and heart problems. Some smokers have also decided to give up smoking. Some of them also think that the law banning smoking can encourage them to give up smoking. Above all, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants.
