I agree with the statement. There are two reasons that I support this opinion. First, part-time jobs are the only opportunity to experience what a job is and how it works, before entering a company. Before entering universities(even after entering them), almost no students have decided what type of jobs they want to do or which company they are interested in. For those students, part-time jobs are good chance to find a job which they truly want to do. Also, in Japan, once we enter a company, it's very difficult to quit the job and to find another job, even if the job is uncomfortable. However, you could have many part-time jobs and quit them easily. I myself have been working in the cram school, and I learned a lot of things. Second, most university students don't receive their allowance from their parents. So, they have to work to earn money for leisure activities, for payment of mobile phones, or dating with their boy/girlfriend. In some clubs whose club dues are high, all members do a part time job as a club activity. For them, part-time jobs are a very important for their daily lives. To conclude, I strongly suggest that university students try to experience part-time jobs as much as possible, as long as they do not become an obstacle to studying.
