I agree with the statement because of the following reasons. First, when we breathe the smoke, we sometimes cough or develop a sore throat. That is a bad thing for us. Second, the smell of smoke is very bad. Some people may think that everyone should tolerate the smell, because smoking gives smokers refreshment like a drink makes people refreshed. So, they think smoking in restaurants is not a bad thing. However, there is a serious problem in smoking: cigarette smoke contains many harmful products like nicotine. Such products are said to cause cancer. Moreover, they harm not only smokers but also people near them. Smoking gives us not so much refreshment as illness. In Japan, smoking seats are separated from non-smoking seats in many restaurants, but they are not completely separated. When we sit in the non-smoking seats, smoke comes into the area and we breathe in harmful substances. That makes no means to separate the seats. Japanese restaurants sometimes have enough space, so I think it difficult to separate them completely. If smoking were banned in every restaurant, we would have no trouble with smoking. So, stores like restaurants should ban smoking.
