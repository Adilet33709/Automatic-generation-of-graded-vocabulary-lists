I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job for several reasons. First, you can earn money on your own. When we are growing up, the entire bill for studying is paid by our parents. Usually one enters college at the age of eighteen. Eighteen years old means you are an adult, so you should share the economical load of your family. You can use the money to pay for your registration and learn to be independent. Second, you can learn how to deal with problems encountered in your work. When you solve these problems, you can get experiences that will one day help you when you graduate from school. Last, you can make friends from your work. A good friend will be of help in your future work, especially when you are in trouble. He can save you when you need help. But as a student, your primary goal is to get good grades to pass the exam, so you shouldn't spend too much time at your part-time job. You need time to study and to go to class. Try to distribute your time among your class, part-time job, hobbies, and the rest! Those things must be balanced or you will regret it in the future.
