I agree with the statement. Some people may think that there are disadvantages to students having part-time jobs. These people worry about students spending a lot of time on the job and not having enough time to study. However, I think that their concern is nonsensical because students know the importance of study, and they will study in their free time. I think there is more advantage to having a part-time job than disadvantage because of the following reasons. First, I think that doing a part-time job will help students' parents. Having a part-time job makes students earn extra money. Thanks to that extra money, some poor parents who cannot earn enough money for their child to go to college can send their children to college. Second, having a part-time job makes students develop economic independence from their parents, and they can realize the importance of money. Third, the most important reason I think, it is useful for them to experience working life before they work at a company. If they have a part-time job, they can take responsibility and get many job skills, for example, greeting people, conversation, presentation and so on. So, they will be able to work better than those who have never experienced a job. That's why I think having a part-time job is important for students.
