It is true that having a part-time job is an important part of university life. Students with part-time jobs can often earn extra money and get various experiences. With a part-time job, students can earn their own money, rather than continuing to receive financial aid from their parents. They can be financially independent and get involved in their financial planning and management. On the other hand, part-time jobs are related to different skills training and experiences. Students could learn specific skills by training for different types of jobs, so they might have experiences of being a tutor, a teacher, a waiter, or a salesperson. Most experiences can help in future occupations, but it is important that the job relate to your studies or plans. However, many people claim that part-time jobs are time-consuming, and students at different stages of their studies should put their academic work first. From my viewpoint, university students should have good time management; if not, a part-time job is a good chance for them to learn. In addition, nowadays, we are concerned about multi-competencies, which is why we have to study at university. As having a part-time job is a fantastic way to earn money, it should be recommended.
