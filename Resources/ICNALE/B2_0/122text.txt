Smoking has been a serious problem for too long a period. In the whole country, measures have been carried out to prohibit smoking in many public places, such as restaurants. As far as I'm concerned, I'm definitely in favor of this rule. What has been taken into consideration in this rule is first and foremost the health of people. Smoking has been criticized for decades. As is so often pointed out, smoking for a long time is likely to result in lung cancer. However, there are certain quantities of people who just cannot give up the "terrific" feeling of having a cigarette, even though they are clearly aware that they are risking their health. It's not other people's business if they only smoke alone, but when they're smoking in public places, especially in restaurants, more concerns should be taken into consideration. Numerous statistics show that "second-hand" smoking is more harmful than smoking directly. Therefore, when a person is enjoying his/her cigarette in restaurants, where people may not be able to stay away from the smoking immediately, s/he is putting the people around her/him in danger, including those who never lay their hands on a cigarette. So, it is reasonable to ban this behavior that is done in no regard of other people. In the second place, the smog and smell produced by cigarettes may make people feel uncomfortable. Usually, a popular restaurant is crowded with people, which has already decreased the quality of the atmosphere in these places. If the smog given out by cigarettes adds to it, many people can barely enjoy their dishes. Besides, the smell is also not pleasant to those who don't smoke at all. Take myself as an example; I can't help sneezing even from a slight smell of a burning cigarette. It's definitely a catastrophe to me if I have to put up with the smog during my dinner. In conclusion, I'm fully convinced that smoking should be banned in all the restaurants in the country.
