One year ago, I had a part-time job as a cashier. While working as a cashier, I felt several disciplines. At the time, I spent money on clothes, accessories, and rings. I didn't know the value of money, but I worked myself so I regretted my spending. I knew that my parents did hard work. And I felt like studying. While working, I wanted to study. Studying is very easy work. I knew that I disliked physical work. I wanted to work in the field of knowledge. So, I always wrote my income and expenses. When I got some pocket money, I didn't spend it. I saved everything in my savings account, and I really studied hard to gain knowledge. Part-time work is a very valuable experience. If I had not worked my part-time job, I would not have realized the value of money and the value of studying. It improves my mental quality. I think that people must work in part-time jobs at a young age. These days I get high English marks and am a good student. I must not forget my part-time job. My experience is so informative and helpful. I want to work another job so I want to learn another value. My children suggest that part-time work is a very good experience.
