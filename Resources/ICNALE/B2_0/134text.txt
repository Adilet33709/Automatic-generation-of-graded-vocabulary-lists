Nobody thinks that smoking is healthy, but there are some people who don't want to quit smoking. They usually smoke everywhere; they even smoke in public places. I think they are addicted. If it makes people feel uncomfortable, smokers should be banned from smoking in public places. As you know, smoking causes so many disease, like lung cancer, tuberculosis, other cancers, etc. Its effects are not limited to smokers, but non-smokers are exposed to second hand smoke, too. Here is reason that why smoking should be banned in public places. First, it causes much disease. If it is banned to smoke in public place, it could reduce the smoking rate. As a result, many people could be healthier. It is very easy for second hand smoke to get a disease from second hand smoking. So I think it should be banned to smoke in public places. Second, if it is banned, it could make for cleaner streets. Usually people who smoke throw away butts on the street. Even though there are so many smoking stands, they don't use them, as if it is very natural act. But I think if it were banned, they couldn't throw away a cigarette. So it would make street clean. Third, if it is banned, it could prevent a big fire. Sometimes the cigarette you threw away could make a big fire. Of course, there are fires of other origins, but I think if you don't smoke in public places it also could reduce the fire rate. Thus I think smoking in public place should be banned by government. If this does not happen, it could make people get diseases, it could make streets unclean and uncomfortable, and it could also make a big fire. So I believe that it should be banned to smoke in public places.
