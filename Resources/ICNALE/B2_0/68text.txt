College students are stuck in a strange period of their lives - they are expected to behave like adults in society, and yet do not have the financial prowess of one. Mired in a busy schedule of academic work, the results of which will probably have a critical effect on the rest of their lives, college students can sometimes barely find the time to enjoy an adequate social life, much less ensure a fixed income for their ever-increasing appetite for spending and consuming. It is therefore exceptionally beneficial for students to partake in some form of temporary or part-time job in the hours outside of class to support their growing expenditures. They will be less reliant on parents' allowances or avoid the need to scrimp and save, allowing for more self-sufficiency and growing pride in the ability to support themselves. While it is certainly good to gain some financial independence, the trade-off for such part-time jobs would be reduced time spent on studies, on making friends and networks that can only be made in college, and spending less time on extra-curricular activities that will develop into useful skills and interests for life. Moreover, part-time jobs usually have meager pay, and the learning opportunities for a temporary staff member is small to say the least - the costs of such a job can far outweigh its returns, and thus students may be better off not having a part-time job. Therefore, it is sometimes far more important to make sure one is making full use of his or her college life - a once in a lifetime occurrence - rather than spend precious time slaving away for a little bit of money.
