Cigarette smoking remains a favorite diversion for Filipinos. In our country, even though we have been warned by the government that cigarettes are dangerous to health, they remain a best-selling product for all ages because they are accessible in most public places, including small stalls in the laneways, men with mobile trays on the roads, and even in the alleyways outside of restaurants. I agree that smoking should be completely banned from all restaurants because it is detrimental to one's health. Numerous diseases and illnesses including asthma, cardio pulmonary obstructive disease (COPD), and lung cancer may be acquired through smoking. Smoking is not only dangerous to the smoker but also to the person sitting next to him. Second-hand smokers, they say, are more at risk of receiving the negative effects of smoking. Smoking may also cause addiction because it includes the substance nicotine. Smoking in restaurants implies that the smoker has no social etiquette because he/she doesn't consider that smoking may irritate other people, and worse, it may also endanger their health. Many actions have been implemented by the government to lessen this habit, including the recent declaration by President Benigno Aquino III, who is a known smoker, that smoking must be prohibited in all public places and there will be penalties for non-abiders. In order for the government to be successful, strict law enforcement must be administered by authorities and the willing cooperation of the citizens is necessary. I believe that public smoking must be banned, not only in the restaurants, but in all public places.
