To smoke, or not to smoke: that is the question. Desecrating one's own body is one's own business. However, when it comes to polluting the air that billions upon billions depend on, it becomes a grave matter for which everyone is rightfully entitled to an opinion. While some may enjoy having their lungs turn to ash and their lifespan shortened by years, others are more concerned about health of themselves and the world. Asking about whether or not smoking should be banned is just the same as asking the Pope if he's a Christian. Regarding my stance on whether or not smoking should be banned from restaurants, I'll say it bluntly: why the heck not? Another thing about smoking is that it turns people off when they are trying to eat. Who wants to eat when smoke fumes are floating around your face? Why eat at a smoky restaurant, when you can eat at someplace better? The health risks of such a practice are also a con here. Why risk your health when you can live a healthier life and have a better dining experience in a smoke-free place? Children's health should also be considered here. Would you risk your son's or daughter's health just to smoke a cigarette? My stance is they should ban it. Can't you wait to get outside and smoke? Can't you resist the urge to light-up a cigarette? Do you have no shame for the diners who just want a good meal or atmosphere? Let me just say that I don't have anything against smokers, but they should learn to do it at the right time and in the right place. Nobody wants to inhale your smoke. Who wants to breathe the same air that came from your smoky lungs?
