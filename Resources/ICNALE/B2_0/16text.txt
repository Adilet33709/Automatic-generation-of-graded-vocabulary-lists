Smoking it is one of those things that are called “recreational drugs”. Yet for some reason, they are generally accepted in society. We've heard about the adverse effects that smoking causes. We've heard them over and over from every health-promoting program, but putting that aside, don't you think smoking is just being plain inconsiderate to other people? Apart from being utterly dangerous and life-threatening to both first-hand and second-hand smokers, it is simply a violation of social etiquette. This especially applies to public places like restaurants. Just imagine how crazily annoying it would be to have smokers ruin your appetite just when your food arrives. The smoke will surely mess with the appetizing aroma of your food. Eventually, your whole food experience will seem unfulfilling and just plain terrible. This is why banning smoking in such places would be good for our society. Restaurants are closed areas; therefore, smoking inside such areas can cause a lot of discomfort for everyone in the restaurant. Clearly, it is not only those who are trying to enjoy a nice meal that are affected. Even those just chilling-out in the area are also being bombarded with the distasteful smell and smoke. In short, smoking in restaurants and other public places exposes random people to harm. Still, it is not only the customers who experience this dilemma with smoking. By smoking in such places, one also threatens the restaurant since it definitely discourages customers. Smoking ruins the ambiance that the restaurant works to establish for their customers to enjoy. Therefore, implementing a law regarding smoking would be best. Smoking should definitely be banned in restaurants and the like. Needless to say, smoking is harmful and incredibly annoying.
