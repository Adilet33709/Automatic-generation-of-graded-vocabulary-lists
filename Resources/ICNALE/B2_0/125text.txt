It is a well-known fact that millions die from smoking every year. It has been long proven that smokers not only harm themselves by smoking, but harm others around them, too. Exposure to second-hand smoke is more damaging than smoking itself. In Singapore, smoking in restaurants has already been banned. A designated area is required to smoke not just in restaurants but even in hawker and shopping cents. Smokers, on the other hand, think that this is against their rights and freedom. In my opinion, however, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. The primary reason people visit restaurants is to eat, not to smoke. We have to consider the various health issues. In a setting like restaurants, with air-conditioning, smoke can stink up the whole place. Smoke can also trigger asthma and irritate throats. Food can become bland and smells come from nearby smoke. It is easy to see that restaurants can lose non-smoking customers as a result. Smoking in public has already influenced and encouraged youth to smoke. If places such as restaurants and hawker centres allow smoking, youth will undoubtedly learn to smoke from the adults. Hence, in my honest opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants and hawker centres.
