Smoking, as we all know, is harmful to our health. Thousands of lung cancer deaths have been caused by smoking and breathing in secondhand smoke. As a non-smoker, I cannot agree more with banning smoking at all restaurants. Secondhand smoke can cause many innocent people to die. Many cases show that not only the smoker, but also the secondhand smoker suffers from different kinds of diseases such as lung cancer and heart disease. Therefore, the restaurants, where we go often, should ban smoking to prevent innocent people from breathing in harmful smoke. Banning smoking at all restaurants can show the support of the local government for a non-smoking environment and the health of its citizens. People will be more aware about the harmfulness of smoking if the government bans smoking and promotes a non-smoking life. The most important thing is that restaurants are places for people to gather with families and friends. How can you enjoy a dinner when you are forced to breathe in secondhand smoke? It cannot help even if the restaurant has divided its area into smoking and non-smoking areas. The smoke can still circulate in the restaurant. Smoking should be banned at all restaurants to provide citizens with a comfortable place for dining. Last, smoking is not good for anyone. We should all support a non-smoking environment and pursue a healthy life.
