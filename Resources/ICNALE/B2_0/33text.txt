In my childhood, my father always smoked near me. I thought that smoking was not a bad thing, but in middle school I saw a video that showed that smoking is so bad for people's bodies. I realized that smoking is a very bad thing. I do not smoke, but I am sure that my body is so bad. Because of my father, I experienced secondhand smoking. I don't care about people smoking, but smokers must not smoke near non-smokers. When I wait for a bus at the bus stop, I smell smokers' smoke. It is so bad, smoking near non-smokers. Sometimes, I went to restaurants, cafes and campus. I think that smoking is an unpleasant thing. The government must make non-smoking areas and introduce a smoking penalty system. When I am an adult, I will ban smoking for my children, because it is so bad for a mom with a baby. Smoking is also banned in playgrounds and kindergarten. This gives health benefits. I saw on television that a famous comedian died because of smoking. I was so scared when I saw his death. When I go to a computer fee room, I always feel smoking smell. Smoking should be removed forever.
