I agree with this. My main reason for agreeing is because smoking is really bad for oneâs health. I have heard that it's poisonous to breathe somebody's smoke. I mean if someone smokes in front of a non-smoker, the non-smoker could be affected sometimes more than the smoker. Some restaurants separate the seats for non-smokers, but the smoke could still reach to non-smokers. In the restaurant, we should enjoy the dishes without smoke. In many countries, smoking in restaurants is not allowed. Japan is too oblivious to the smoking problem. There are no good points to smoking. We have to think about this more seriously. Me, I don't smoke and I really hate smoking. But actually I have many friends who smoke. I can't tell them to stop smoking, although I am worried about their health, as I also know how hard it is to stop smoking and they want to stop if they can. One of my friends who often smokes said that she doesn't know how to stop smoking so she wants some non-poisonous substitute. I don't think smoking should be banned completely everywhere so far because it would be so hard for smokers, but I hope some kind of substitute will be made as she said. What I want to say is that smoking should be banned at least in the restaurants, but not everywhere. We should think not only for non-smokers but also for smokers.
