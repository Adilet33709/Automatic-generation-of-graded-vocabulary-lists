I agree with it. Because they need training to work before they graduate. Studying in college is very different from working in society. If they don't study hard that is a personal problem but if employees don't work hard that is not a personal problem. If they have a part-time job they can learn  a lot. For example: responsibility, hospitability, communication skills, how to solve problems, and so on. They will also quickly get used to working when they have a full-time job as they have experience working. But working in college is not the only thing to do. Of course they need to study and read. If they don't study their college fee is of no use. However a lot of students tend to take their time to work for money that they can use for what they want. They need social training but they have to understand what is important to do now. They can work as much as they want after they graduate. But college life only happens one time for many students. So it is important for college students to have a part time job, and it is also important for them to study. Balance is key to success in their college days.
