Many bad habits have worsened our society. Smoking is one that starts as a fashion but soon becomes a habit. In the early days, people used clay pipes to smoke, and with the passage of time, old ways of smoking developed, resulting in modern times in cigarettes. People start out smoking cigarettes as fashion, as is common among young people who boast of belonging to high society, but after time it becomes a habit that is very difficult to quit. It is one of the most dangerous substances, adversely affecting human health. Physically, it directly affects and strongly damages the lungs, which creates many other problems for the human body. A strong and healthy person becomes weak and susceptible to many other harmful diseases. Moreover, smoking is not only dangerous for the addicted individual, but is also very harmful to others. When people exhale cigarette smoke, they emit toxic chemicals and germs that threaten the health of others’. It is very difficult for a person addicted to smoking to quit the habit. These days, many people go to restaurants. However, many smokers do not have sufficient manners or self-control not to disturb other diners. Worst of all, the most unpleasant impact from smoking in restaurants is that the smoke makes food dirty, spoiling the freshness and nutritional value of food. Smoking is thus both directly and indirectly harmful.
