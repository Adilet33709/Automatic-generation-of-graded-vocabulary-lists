Nowadays, more and more college students work at part-time jobs in their spare time as salesmen, waiters, or shop assistants. They are engaged in part-time jobs because they want to earn some money to help their family with tuition fees. In the meantime, they also gain work experience. People wonder whether it is good for students to do so. Some people are afraid that taking a part-time job will require too much of the students’ time, that it will influence their studies. Some people disagree with them. They think that it will be a good way for young students to know how hard it is to earn money and to gain experience from it. To have a part-time job is a hot topic today. In my view, I agree with the latter opinion for several reasons. First, students can earn some money from the part-time jobs to help their family. Second, they can learn a lot from it, and get the chance to show how much they have learned from school. Last but not least, a part-time job can train their ability to work, cooperate, and get along with others. In other words, getting a part-time job is not only good for earning money but also good for studying and improving abilities! Thus, if you have the chance, try to get a part-time job.
