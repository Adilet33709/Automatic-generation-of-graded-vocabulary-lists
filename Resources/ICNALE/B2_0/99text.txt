Is a part-time job important to university students? As a university student, I do not have a part-time job. However, I do think a part-time job is quite essential for an undergraduate for several reasons. Firstly, university fees are high. By having a part-time job, a student can earn money to pay for part of the university fees. This can ease the strain of the breadwinner of the family. Secondly, having some work experience before graduating can be an advantage when applying for jobs in the future. Employers in all companies will prefer to employ a person with rich experience than a person with none. Thirdly, having a part-time job can enable students to practice their time management skills. If you can do well academically while doing well in your part-time job, you will become an expert in time management. As a result, a part-time job is important to a university student. However, if your academic result might be affected by having a part-time job, it is better to focus on your studies rather than have a part-time job.
