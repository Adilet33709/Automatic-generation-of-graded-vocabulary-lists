Part-time jobs may or may not be important for college students. It may be essential to be employed as a part-timer for those who belong to families that are unable pay the required tuition fees and other expenses. A job is important to enable these students to continue their college education and to improve their life in the future. A part-time job can provide the student with experiences that may enhance their social and personal skills. Some jobs may also be related to the course being taken by the student, for example, a 2nd year tourism student who is working as a part-time receptionist in a travel agency. A lot of learning opportunities outside of the classroom may be gained by having a part-time job. On the other side, for students who have parents and benefactors who can provide all of the financial support needed to attain a degree, a part-time job is not important because being a student is a full-time job that needs 100% of one's attention, time, effort, and dedication. Part-time jobs may cause the student's attention to be divided from his/her studies. It may also alter the regular schedule because it is necessary for working students to select a schedule that will fit perfectly with his/her working shifts. Jobs may also mean less time is spent on reviewing and studying. Sleeping and resting periods that are important for the student's overall well-being, concentration, and attentiveness may also be greatly affected. Fatigue and additional stress can also be expected by a working student. These disadvantages of having a part-time job, however, may be overcome by the student's capabilities, values, and attitudes, thus working while studying may be possible.
