Smoking has been quite popular ever since the advent of cigarettes and cigars. Smokers claim that they can give an infinite list of advantages of smoking such as its ability to provide people with focus. The protestors, on the contrary, strongly require that smoking be completely banned at public places such as restaurants. They argue that smoking severely harms human health. From my perspective, the latter opinion is more favorable, especially when referring to restaurants. First, allowing smoking will reduce the number of customers that come to the restaurant. When choosing which restaurant to go to, the customers value hygiene. Since smoking causes harm not only to the smoker himself but also to the people around them, it can drive away a considerable number of customers. In addition, forbidding smoking in all restaurants can help many smokers to stop smoking. Most people fail to quit smoking because smoking is inevitable when having parties in restaurants, and because on such occasions, people always try to persuade others to smoke. These people hate smoking but they have to suffer from it against their will. Thus, if smoking is banned in all restaurants, many people who used to yield to others’ persuasion can be relieved from smoking. Briefly, smoking does far more harm than good to all people in the long term, so disallowing smoking in all restaurants is beneficial to all customers. Now that giving up smoking is one of the ultimate goals of the society, starting with restaurants is surely a wise choice due to the reasons stated above.
