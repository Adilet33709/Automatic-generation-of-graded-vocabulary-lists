A part-time job is one of the skills every college student needs before getting a job. It is like a training period for college students who are about to embark on their future career. It is also a source of income for independent students, for those who pay for their tuition, or for those who want to have an extra allowance. Having a part-time job also has its pros and cons, but these are based on the person taking the job. Maybe for some it is difficult but other people may enjoy every minute of it. People are never what they seem; it will always surprise you what people can really do in life. When you have a part-time job, you earn extra money and when you have extra money no one will stop you from buying whatever you want. Whether it's a Christian Dior dress or a Louis Vuitton bag, no one can stop you from buying those things since the money is yours and you have the right to spend it on anything that you want. People may think you're a spender but when you earn something by yourself and buy the things you want, you feel ecstatic, excited, happy, and proud of yourself. However, getting a part-time job depends on whether you are busy with school projects or not. Of course, studies are our first priority when it comes to school. Part-time jobs teach us how to prioritize our time because we have a part-time job for an additional allowance or for money, but study should always come first for college students around the world who have part-time jobs.
