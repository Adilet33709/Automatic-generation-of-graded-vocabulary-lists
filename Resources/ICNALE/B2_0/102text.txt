With more importance being attached to health, people are beginning to search for different ways to stay healthy. Of course, as stress from people's daily life increases more and more, the number of people who smoke increases as well. Nonetheless, there is a problem concerning whether smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. In my view, it is needed. First, smoking causes many deaths from lung cancers. Second-hand smoke affects pregnant women, children and elderly people more. Smoking is also a bad example for teens and young adults, as it shows that it is okay to smoke. Smoking should be banned in restaurants. Whether there is a non-smoking section or a smoking section does nothing. The smoke still spreads throughout the restaurant. Some people are sensitive to cigarette smoke. Further, smoking doesn't just cause damage to other people’s health, it is smelly as well. People who are non-smokers do not want to smell like smoke. Thus, this ban must be implemented. A non-smoking person should be able to sit down in a restaurant and not inhale unhealthy smoke while they eat. If people want to smoke, they can go outside, or if the restaurant is smart enough, it would create a whole new room that is separate from the non-smokers. As far as I am concerned, it is necessary to completely ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country.
