I agree with this statement because smoking is bad for other customers and for restaurants. I'll talk about why smoking is bad for other customers. It's bad for health and enjoying food. As it is known widely, smoking is worse for secondary receivers of its smoke than for smokers themselves. There are many people affected by secondhand smoke, including, of course, children. To avoid the health problem of non-smokers and children, smoking should be banned. In addition, it's bad for eating food. In my case, I cannot enjoy eating if others smoke. I have a terrible headache when I smell smoke. How can I enjoy the food? Even if the smoking zone is separated, I can smell smoke when I go to the bathroom or something like a drink-bar. Then, as I said, I get a headache. It's a good idea to have a separate smoking zone, but it's best to ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country. And next, I'll tell you why it's bad for restaurants. When I see people who smoke in the restaurant, I always wonder if they enjoy the food. I think they don't. Smells and tastes are diminished by smoking. A restaurant is a place where we enjoy eating and restaurants must think they want customers to enjoy the taste of their food. If restaurants really think this way, they must ban smoking to let customers enjoy their delicious food. Smoking is bad for other customers and for restaurants, so smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
