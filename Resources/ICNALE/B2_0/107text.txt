I agree with the statement. First of all, I really hate smell of smoke. The smell is very strong and it does not go away until I take a bath and take off my clothes. It is very uncomfortable. Once the smell sticks with me, I have to be with it all day. I can't believe it. Second of all, restaurants are public places. Everyone is in there, including babies and old people who can't protect their bodies strongly. Public places should be safe. Besides, people usually have a good time with family or friends having a delicious meal and enjoying their conversations in a restaurant. Nobody can interrupt their leisure time. Smokers should put up with not smoking in restaurants, because their visit only lasts an hour or more. Last of all, smoking is nothing but poison for smokers and people around smokers. It is so harmful that it causes lung cancer. Now everyone knows it. It is like a crime to smoke in public places; it hurts people, even though the bad effect is invisible at that time. But it is certain that smoking destroys our health, so it is natural that smoking should be banned in public places.
