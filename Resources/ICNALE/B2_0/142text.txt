It is universally recognized that smoking does much damage to human health and that second-hand smoking causes even more serious effects to the people around smokers. According to the statistics shown in newspapers, about five percent of deaths are related to second-hand smoking. Due to the terrible effects of public smoking, I hold the opinion that smoking should be banned in any public restaurants across the country. By doing so, one of the most important favorable effects is that diseases related to smoking, such as lung cancer, can be cut down significantly. The ban contributes a lot to the creation of a healthy dining environment for people who frequently eat outside, which takes up a large proportion of the whole population. Secondly, prohibiting smoking in some public areas contributes greatly to the development of social culture and ideology. Like drunken driving, which poses threats to citizens' safety, smoking in public does harm to others' health. Such behavior is against our goal of establishing a harmonious society. In addition, the forceful act of a complete ban raises the awareness of the harm of smoking among the general public. More and more smokers will gradually get rid of this bad habit for the interest of their own health. To conclude, it is high time for us to take strong measures to put an end to this smoking era. A complete change to the legal system regarding the smoking issue is necessary for the final settlement of this social problem.
