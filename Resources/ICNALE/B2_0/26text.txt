People’s manners in public are a good way to show the quality of the people in a country; hence, smoking, which produces a bad influence on the environment and our health, should be completely banned at all restaurants to keep up good manners. Smoking does great damage to the health of smokers and the people around them; for example, second-hand smoke greatly influences the consumers while they’re having dinner. Moreover, a place that is full of smoke would damage the dinner atmosphere and have a bad effect on the consumers' feelings. Thus, from both the consumers’ and the restaurants’ sides, smoking should be completely banned. Besides, as we all know, the behaviors in public decide the quality of the people in the country. If smoking isn't banned in restaurants, the image and quality of the Chinese will be misunderstood. Our country has become stronger and more powerful within these years, and so the quality of the people should be improved by the efforts of all of us. However, the government and the restaurants should also learn from the experiences of the 2010 Shanghai EXPO. We can build some places for smoking, or just set a room for the smokers, as this is a concern for them. Thus, smoking should be banned, but we should also spare some room for the smokers.
