Today, an increasing number of college students have part-time jobs. Have you ever taken a part-time job? There are many advantages for us from taking part-time jobs. Firstly, part-time jobs help us keep up with the outside world. We can gain working experience and become more independent. Besides, it's a good chance for us to put what we have learned at college into practice. Through part-time jobs, we can prepare ourselves for our future jobs. What's more, we can make money to pay for everything that we want. Alternatively, it can help relieve our family’s financial burden. However, there are also many disadvantages. If we have part-time jobs, they are likely to distract us from studying. We may spend too much time and energy on working. For example, we may lose the time needed for sleep, rest, studying, club activities, and recreation. It may thus be harmful to our health. In my opinion, college students should have the right attitude when it comes to part-time jobs. Although part-time jobs can open a window for us to learn about society, we must keep a balance between the job and our studies! However, I do think I should pay more attention to my academic studies.
