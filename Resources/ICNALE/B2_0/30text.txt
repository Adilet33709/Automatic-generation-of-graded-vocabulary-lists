Many people believe that having a meal and cigarettes is part of our social life and doing business. However, while it is well known that smoking is bad for human's health, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First of all, a second-hand smoke environment is worse than actually smoking cigarettes. A restaurant is a place for families, and people including kids and pregnant women, to have a nice meal. If you allow people to smoke during the meal, it's not only very rude to other guests having a meal with you but also harmful to other customers sitting in the same restaurant. Second, all those customers who don't smoke might stop coming to the restaurants, which would reduce the income of the restaurants and make them close down. The taste of food would be destroyed by smoking at the same moment as well. It is not a proper way to enjoy a nice lunch/dinner. Last but not least, smoking is not a requirement during the meal. Normally people want to smoke after the meal instead of during the eating process. If people want to have a more relaxing conversation by having a cigarette, they can also go outside or some other places such as a lounge bar. Smoking in a restaurant is not only impolite but also has a bad influence on other customers' health. To sum up, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
