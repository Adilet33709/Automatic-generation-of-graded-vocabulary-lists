Small and poorly ventilated restaurants are full of disgusting smoke when you have a meal. How do you feel? Obviously, it is not acceptable. In my opinion, it is reasonable to ban smoking at all restaurants completely. Although smokers have the right to smoke when they need to, they also have a responsibility to let non-smokers enjoy a clean environment. Sometimes, for convenience, some smokers just throw their cigarette ends on the floor inside restaurants. I do not think anybody likes to have meal in such dirty restaurants. Hence, the income of the restaurant is likely affected. Nowadays, more people are concerned about the issue of banning smoking because they are alerted to the hazards of secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke is as harmful as firsthand smoke. During an hour’s meal, the smoke irritates our respirational system, and because of the smoke, non-smokers have a greater chance of suffering from deadly diseases such as lung cancer. Overall, to prevent others’ suffering and to ensure they have a nice meal, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants as soon as possible.
