Nowadays, more and more students tend to have a part-time job in their leisure time so that they can earn some pocket money by themselves. Different people have various opinions about this issue. Some people think that it is the golden chance for college students to put their knowledge into practice by themselves, while others believe that it is a waste of time to do a part-time job. As for me, I feel that a part-time job does more good than harm. Generally speaking, it's important for college students to have a part-time job. To begin with, a part-time job will provide more social experience. Those who have a part-time job are more likely to get in touch with various people in society. They can learn how to get along with different people and solve a problem in a short time. It's not hard for us to find that the students with a part-time job are more active and efficient in both their studies and their work. In addition, a part-time job will show them the significance of cooperation. If students would like to work at a part-time job, they must talk to their workmates and cooperate with them. Their habit of cooperation will also play an important role in teamwork on campus. However, on the other hand, if one spends so much time on a part-time job that it affects one’s study, then one should decrease the time spent on working or give it up, for our main duty at present is to study well, not to earn money. In other words, a part-time job is really beneficial to us, so let's take an active part in it!
