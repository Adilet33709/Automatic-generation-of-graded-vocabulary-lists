I agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. A few years ago, smoking was not important to all of us. But now, people's thinking has changed. Comedian Lee Jug-el died of lung cancer. To this day, I can't forget about what he said to the public about smoking. He was as smoker for many years. Before he died, he made an authorized advertisement. In the ad, he appealed to people who had been smoking for many years. He said when you are smoking, you have to stop smoking. If you don't stop, that destroys your family and your life. For example, a man is smoking at the restaurant; we think that he is polite. When he is smoking, he doesn't mind everybody in the restaurant. If he has a thought that he�@should take care of his family or friends, he can't smoke there. Now, people don't allow smoke in the building so we can see people who find the smoking area which is outside of building. Also, if someone smokes at a restaurant, cigarette smoke makes the people annoyed. We want to have the food in fresh air and we don't want to die early because of cigarette smoke. So, if you smoke for years, you have to stop smoking for your future, your family, and your friends.
