Every year, the number of smokers is growing. According to the Department of Health in the Republic of the Philippines, there is currently an estimated 1. 3 billion smokers, as of last year. This number of smokers includes males and females aged 15 and above. Smoking should be completely banned, not just in all restaurants, but also in public places across the country. Most restaurants are air conditioned; they don't allow smokers inside their restaurants but they still damage the freshness of the air outside. Some restaurants allow smokers to smoke, but only in the smoking area. Smoking is already a part of a smoker's life; some smoke after eating and some smoke during a drinking session. Some say that it makes them feel better and calms them but they don't even think about what smoking can do, not only to their health but also to their life. They don't think about their surroundings and the people that might be affected. As we all know, smoking is very dangerous to one's health and can cause you to develop lung cancer. It affects not only your lungs but also the other internal organs of your body. It also affects the health of the second-hand smokers and workers inside restaurants. Smoking can risk your life; you can even die from it. As a very good piece of advice: stop smoking early before it's too late. Try to avoid smoking gradually until you can control it and stop it completely.
