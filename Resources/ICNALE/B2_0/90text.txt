Do students need a part-time job? Yes, I think so. Part-time jobs will not only help them financially but also personally. The material benefit of having a part-time job is money. The money earned through this journey will help to pay for the tuition, rent, and the other financial needs of the student. These are the material benefits, but what about the personal benefit? Through working hard, students can become more responsible with their money, and their personality. Students don't want to spend their hard-earned money on useless things, so they'll become wiser regarding how they spend their money. What about their personality? Through working with other colleagues or with customers individuals can become more socially-capable. This will help them in the future when they are looking for a real job by preparing them for what the real world will throw at them. However, having a part-time job also has its negatives. What time the job starts can affect the academics of the student. Is it safe? Different jobs may also have some risks associated. However, this can be avoided if you pick a good job and a safe place to work. In short, jobs may seem boring and tiring, but it will be ultimately beneficial financially. Wouldn't it better if you can buy your own things with your own hard-earned money? The feeling of working hard to buy your own things gives you a sense of achievement. This motivation will drive you forward; it will give you more motivation to work harder. Will this make me a better person? Yes, it will. It will be like a new you, you will be more productive and take initiative.
