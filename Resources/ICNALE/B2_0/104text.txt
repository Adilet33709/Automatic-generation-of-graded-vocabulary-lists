According to www.inforesearchlab.com, around 5.4 million deaths per year worldwide are caused by tobacco use, while www.cdc.gov reports that almost 90% of all deaths from chronic obstructive lung disease are caused by smoking, which is rated as the number one cause of death in the United States. Even without looking at these figures, we can see that people around us keep smoking despite the danger and diseases it causes. Therefore, smoking should be banned in all countries worldwide. There are three reasons for this. First, smoking is the source of almost all cancer diseases, starting from the most common cancers caused by smoking, lung cancer and cancer of the esophagus, to many other cancers, such as kidney cancer and stomach cancer. Second, besides causing many diseases in its users, some fatal, smoking also has a dangerous effect on secondhand smokers, and in particular, secondhand smoke or passive smoke has even more dangerous effects for people like children and non-smokers, increasing their chances of developing cancer. Lastly, smoking also has an environmental impact on the earth and one’s surroundings. Cigarette butts that are discarded on the ground and are not picked up end up in rivers where fish eat them, smoke from cigarettes contributes to global warming, and smoking also pollutes the air around us. For this reason, in light of the dangerous effects of smoking, smoking should be banned for our own good.
