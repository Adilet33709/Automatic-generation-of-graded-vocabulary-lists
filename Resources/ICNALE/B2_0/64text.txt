I think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job during their college period. The following are some reasons why I consider having a part-time job is beneficial. To begin with, going to a college is like preparing to establish your future career. Students learn and study knowledge for what might be useful one day. If you can have a part-time job while you are studying, you can learn more efficiently from not only the textbook but also the real life experiences. In addition, having a part-time job can help you to gain respect from peers and establish relationships with others. Take myself as an example; I was once working in the National Theater as a receptionist. I learned how important it is to communicate and listen to customers. I became more eloquent when talking to others for I needed to give specific orders to my peers to help them accomplish some tasks. In fact, participating in both school and work was pretty exhausting. The tight schedule nearly made me fall to pieces. However, following that tough period, I can embrace challenges instead of giving up whenever I am faced with difficulties. I became more patient with people, and I welcome any criticism. In conclusion, having a part-time job can help college students learn more efficiently, gain lots of experience, handle pressure well with patience, and welcome criticism. As a result, it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
