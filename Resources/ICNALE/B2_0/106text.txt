I disagree with this statement. In my opinion, smoking should not be banned completely for two reasons. First, a smoker has a right to smoke as long as it doesn't become a nuisance to other members of the public. In the restaurant, if they make some area or tables for smokers, smoking will not trouble other people. In some public place where we can't separate non-smokers from smokers such as sidewalks in a big city or platforms at station during rush hour, I think, of course, we should ban smoking completely. But if we just set the table for smokers, there could be no problem. Actually, at many restaurants they arrange tables for both groups (smokers and non-smokers), and this is considered to be a good idea and seems to have been successful. Second, if smoking were banned completely at all restaurants, smokers would hesitate to go to restaurants. In this situation, the profit of restaurants would decrease and eventually the economy would also be negatively impacted. It is true that the number of smokers is decreasing, but there are still large numbers of people who enjoy smoking. I have a friend who smokes very often. He said that he didn't want to go to a restaurant in which smoking is banned. So, if we shut out those people from restaurants or cafés, there would be a negative impact on the Japanese economy. As I said above, I disagree with the statement that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in Japan.
