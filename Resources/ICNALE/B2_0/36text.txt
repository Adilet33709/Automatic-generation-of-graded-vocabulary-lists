Smoking is really a strange thing for me and confuses me a lot. Every time I stand at the bus stop waiting for the bus to come, walk on the streets, or even stand in front of a restaurant waiting for my meals, I can often smell some bad and disgusting smell which comes from some other people's smoke. "Disgusting second-hand smoke again!" I can't help but feel uncomfortable immediately owing to the smoke. "How can people be fond of smoking and even have to smoke a lot every day?" As far as I am concerned, smoking is no good for people. Not only does it harm your health and your lungs, but it also takes so much of your money to buy the cigarettes. You have to face the risk of getting lung cancer, spend a lot of money, and you are even hated by some other people. Then, why can't smokers stop smoking? I think some smokers can't quit because it makes them feel relaxed and they are even addicted in it. Therefore, it seems hard for those smokers to quit. And for some teenagers, they may think smoking is a cool thing and start to have the bad habit. However, I don't think people should keep smoking no matter what the reasons are. Smoking can not only harm your health but also harm the health of others. And it also makes the city more unclean because of the deserted cigarettes which are on the ground everywhere. Therefore, for everyone's health, the city's environment and saving money, I think smokers had better quit the bad habit as soon as they can.
