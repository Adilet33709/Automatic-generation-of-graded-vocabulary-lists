Having a part-time job during university provides many personal and social benefits, not only for the university students, but also for the society. Hence, no matter what, it is essential for students to have a part-time job. On the one hand, students get many personal advantages. They earn money for their daily lives and learn to become financially independent, and they can experience the real society before graduating. It is a rare opportunity for them to build up their networks, which will benefit them a lot in the future. Moreover, it is easier for them to set targets after obtaining work experience. On the other hand, students can benefit the society because people with higher education levels work in positions with higher salaries. Thus, while they are still undergraduates, they can work in the positions at smaller companies that cannot afford to employ educated elites. Not only are students well educated, but they also have more creativity than adults who have worked for many years. Additionally, students have the chance to practice their creativity and critical thinking. Overall, based on the points mentioned above, it is worthwhile and important for university students to have a part-time job.
