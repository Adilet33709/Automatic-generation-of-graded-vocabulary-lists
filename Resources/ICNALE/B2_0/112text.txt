You are right. I agree with the topic. Smoking is terrible, awful and very bad. Smoking must be banned, not only in restaurants but also in any public places! But I think smoking has been banned at a restaurant already. Hasn't it? Imagine you eat at a restaurant and someone smokes next to you. I wouldn't eat anything if I were you. You lose both money and health if you smoke. Eventually, you pay for disease. What a silly idea! I work out, so I've never smoked and I don't even drink. But my father has smoked for over 20 years. I worry about his health. Smoking can also ruin families. Parents need to stop smoking for their children. Last week I saw something about smoking in a newspaper. The government said that now it's illegal to smoke on a road or a square. I love that. I am done talking about smoking. What else I can say is smoking is worse for other people than it is for the smoker! In addition, smoking makes people stink. Who would want to hang out with a smelly person? Right? Ok I need thirty more words. I hate to tell someone to stop smoking. So smokers need to stop smoking. Let's quit smoking!
