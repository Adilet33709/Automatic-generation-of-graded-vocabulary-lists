I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Everyone knows that smoking is not good for us. The smoke contains many kinds of chemical compounds which can cause cancer. If you don't smoke, you can still be threatened by smoke because people around you could be smokers! There is much medical evidence showing that the harmfulness of second-hand smoke is greater than that of first-hand smoke. When someone smokes around you, maybe you will walk to them and say "Excuse me, sir. This is a non-smoking place." Usually this guy would throw away his cigarette and say sorry to you, but sometimes you are not so lucky. This man could say "Why? Why don't you go away?" At this time, the government should make a law to restrict the rights of the smoker and protect those non-smokers. The law should say that one cannot smoke at the place which has more than three people, including restaurants. If someone ignores the law, they should be fined ten thousand NTD. Based on the reason of health, smoking should be banned in public places such as restaurants. If we don't do this, we will suffer from health problems caused by smoke. Next time you eat dinner at a restaurant, no one should smoke beside you.
