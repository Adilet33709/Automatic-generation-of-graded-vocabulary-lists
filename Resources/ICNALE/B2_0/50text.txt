I think college students should not spend time on part-time jobs. I think college students should do things what they can do only when they are college students, for example, read many books, go for a trip, play sports, take part in club activities, etc. Indeed, you'll have some time for these things after starting to work for a company, but there will be less time. Like many people say, you can work as much as you like after graduating from college. The only problem is that all the money you use for these experiences is earned by your parents, not you, so you must be careful not to waste money and time. You should always keep in mind that time is finite. As long as you think the things you are going to do are necessary for your future, you should do them. So, if are willing to be an owner of a restaurant in the future, having a part time job at a restaurant might be a good experience rather than just reading books about management or food. But, in my opinion, I think students should read books. Reading books on various topics will surely have a positive effect on your future.
