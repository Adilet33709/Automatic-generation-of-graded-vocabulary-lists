Stepping into university symbolizes that students are nearing adult society. Besides celebrating their independence from their family, it also means that students will possibly be responsible for their own financial situation. For different reasons, many students apply for part-time jobs. Some want to gain work experience, some want to earn money for luxuries, and some need money to reduce the financial pressure on their families. It is fair to say that their reasons are understandable. However, no matter how fancy their reasons, having a part-time job could affect their studies due to having a packed schedule and experiencing disturbances in their studies. University students should equip themselves to face the upcoming challenges when they graduate. Some part-time jobs actually help students learn many things and help them to prepare for their future careers. However, some only give students a salary and nothing else. I sometimes ask the students what they really expected from their job. I disagree that they should only do a part-time job for money, and I encourage them to prepare themselves for future challenges.
