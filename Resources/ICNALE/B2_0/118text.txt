I disagree with the claim that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Instead, there should be a part of restaurants maintained for the smokers. The supporting reasons are as follows. First, smoking is a basic human right, even though it may be bad for the smoker's and others' health, we cannot forbid people to smoke. Therefore, restaurants that allow smoking should provide spaces for those who want to enjoy eating and smoking at the same time, and then these places can gather those who smoke together and leave those who cannot bear the smell of cigarettes in a comfortable place. Moreover, smoking is a special culture, and we should not wipe it out from the diverse society. Some restaurants provide water-smoke devices, and smokers gather together to share that habit, and tourists even come to visit that kind of restaurant. If the place of sharing a habit disappears, then the culture about the habit is hard to keep. Still, unlike drugs, of which only a little amount can lead to severe and immediate damage to the body and the loss of a working ability, cigarettes are not so dangerous; only a large amount of smoke cigarettes harm people's health. To sum up, smoking is more a right and a habit than a danger. Therefore, smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
