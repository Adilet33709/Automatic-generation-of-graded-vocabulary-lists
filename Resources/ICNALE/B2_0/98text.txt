During your college days, you don't want to waste time but usually many students regret that you squander your time. But I think there are some ways not to waste your time while you study at university. The one of them is to have a part-time job. In fact, many students have part-time jobs, such as waiter, cashier, sales clerk, etc. during their college days to earn money and to gain experience. It is very helpful and very important for students to get a job, even though they don't have to get a part-time job to earn money. I will explain to you that why it is important. First, you can meet various people. Of course, you can meet people at your school but there is a difference between people whom you would meet at your workplace and people whom you would meet at your school. I think talking with various people gives you a lot of ideas. Also, you could have a chance to get information which you want to get. If you do a part-time job that is related to your future work, you can meet some people who have some information you need. It is more advantageous than other people who don't have a part-time job. Second, you earn money having a part-time job, so you can realize how important money is and how to spend money. You could develop a habit of saving money because you don't want to waste the money you earned. Some students waste money, but most students don't waste the money they earned themselves. Thus I think during your college days, doing a part-time job is very helpful, valuable, and worthwhile thing. I recommend you to do a part-time job while you are in university.
