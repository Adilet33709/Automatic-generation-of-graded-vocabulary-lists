Smoking should be banned in all public areas, including restaurants, considering all the potential damage to the health of not only the smokers but also the people around them. At the same time, restaurants are supposed to provide a pleasant dining atmosphere for their customers so that they can enjoy their meal without being annoyed by the terrible smell. It is universally accepted that smoking can lead to severe damage to the respiratory system of smokers and even to people who just smell the smoke. Restaurants are usually crowded with people so that it is not practical to separate smokers from non-smoking customers. Nor is it possible to prevent the diffusion of the cancer-causing smoke. Therefore, it is a public health issue to impose laws to ban smoking in restaurants. Moreover, it is the government's responsibility to ensure that everyone has the right to enjoy their meals in a smoke-free environment. One might argue that smokers should also have their freedom to decide when and where to smoke. However, when they smoke in public, others are deprived of the freedom to choose their dining environment. They are forced to intake the smoke while they are eating. Smoking in public is just like any other form of crime that satisfies one's needs while sacrificing others’ legitimate rights.
