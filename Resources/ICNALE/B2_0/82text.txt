I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job; first, college students should be responsible for their behaviors, and not rely on their parents all the time, even for daily life spending. They can earn a living by getting part-time jobs, so that they will know that earning money is not as easy as they thought. Once they have a part-time job, they will be more careful when spending money and be more responsible for their behaviors. Second, by doing a part-time job, they can make friends with people who have the same interests. For example, if you work as a sales assistant, you will meet someone who is outgoing and also loves to interact with other people; if you work in the kitchen of a restaurant, you will meet someone who is also interested in cooking or baking. So no matter what kind of job you get, you can always find someone who shares the same interests with you. Last but not least; through the job, students can learn something which they cannot learn in school, such as, how to interact with customers and what to do when they complain, and how to work perfectly with co-workers and the boss. They will also know which ability they are lacking, so they can learn even harder during their free time at school. For those three reasons, I totally agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
