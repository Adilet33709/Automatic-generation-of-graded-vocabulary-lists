I strongly believe that students should commit themselves to part-time jobs, especially those who are at the tertiary level. This is because tuition fees are inevitably increasing today. Some parents will have a hard time paying the tuition fees of their children. To lessen the burden our parents are carrying, we must have the guts to help them out. Another reason is for students to gain experience and to develop their strengths and weaknesses. Engaging ourselves with things that we do not usually do can help improve our well-being. One's personality can be changed through socializing and this can also help in applying for full-time jobs in the near future. One can be easily accepted by companies if they already have previous experience, most especially experience that enhances one's skills. Lastly, for students who do not have anything to do during their free hours, taking up a part-time job is the best way to occupy their time. Instead of engaging ourselves in unnecessary matters, we can help not only our family and self but also our country as well. In this way, one can gain extra income for future necessities.
