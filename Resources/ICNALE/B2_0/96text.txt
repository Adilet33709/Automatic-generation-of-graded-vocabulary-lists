All over the globe quality education has its price. This leaves us with the question: do college students need part-time jobs in order to cope up with the expenses they will incur? In my opinion, it is better for the child to focus more on his studies. It is the responsibility of the parents to provide sufficient funds for their children who are studying at university. It is their job to ensure that the child will have enough money to cover all of his expenses. It is the responsibility then of the student to do well in school to repay his parents hard work. Instead of getting a part-time job, it is better if the child saves his excess allowance to help his parents with via small acts. A child studies to acquire sufficient skills and training before facing the real world with confidence and knowledge. If the child has a part-time job, his time will be divided, which gives him less time to focus on his studies. If the child gives his undivided attention to his studies, he will be more able to acquire expertise. It would be more beneficial for the child to render his time fully to his studies to be sufficiently prepared. Also, not having a part-time job will lessen the burden and stress that school already causes for the child. Having a part-time job does have its pros, which include gaining money and real life experience, but it also means that the child will have less time for his studies and perhaps may later lose focus on them.
