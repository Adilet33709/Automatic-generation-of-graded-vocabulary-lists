A part-time job is something we do besides our regular work or studies. In the real world, most people are independent and work part-time to better meet their basic needs, and some do it to be able to pay for their studies themselves. Education is very costly, and not everyone can afford it. Therefore, students on scholarships or studying abroad, as well as those from poor families work part-time to pay their tuition and fees. Moreover, some people work part-time for fun or to gain experience. Part-time jobs include teaching in a bank or an organization. I myself taught while I was studying, just for the passion of teaching. Our society has some boundaries because some are hesitant work. In western culture, however, work is appreciated. People must be hard-working and most enjoy sincerely doing whatever they do, whether study or work. I personally feel that as a student you must do some work during your studies to gain experience and increase confidence in management, besides being able to pay your expenses and reduce the burden on your parents. They can work in franchises or teach. Part-time jobs are very helpful in today’s world, especially in our country, as we all have experienced crises. Most of us do not feel shy about doing any work that is respectable, and in fact do so eagerly.
