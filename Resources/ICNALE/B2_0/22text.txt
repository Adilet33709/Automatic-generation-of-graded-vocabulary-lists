I think that college students should have a part-time job before graduating from university, because if they donft have any experience of a part-time job, they will be embarrassed in society. In my case when I was a freshman, I worked for Lotto Riau as a part-time worker for one year. My parents recommended me to have a part-time job before going to army. I think it was good experience for me to meet various people and earn a little money. Even though I got living money from my parents, that was not enough to live. But since I had a part-time job, I could live better than if I didn't have it. There was a bad aspect. It meant I couldn't concentrate on my study. After working for 6 months, I thought about whether I would stop working or not. My choice was keep it going. At that time, I was young, so I had many chances in the future and I had to go to the army. Now I don't regret it. If I was a freshman, I would work also. Some people think having a part-time job is a well-spent time in their life. Otherwise people who would have a part-time job, they will be more successful than someone with no experience. If you are living in Korea, I want you to have a part-time job when you are young.
