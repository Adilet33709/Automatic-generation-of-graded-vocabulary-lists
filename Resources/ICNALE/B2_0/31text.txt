As a non-smoker, it would be easy for me to advocate for the banning of smoking in all restaurants across the country. However, I do believe that we have to take into account the interests of smokers to a certain degree. The primary issue at stake is secondhand smoke, which is a problem that arises when smoking is permitted in a place that non-smokers frequent. Research has shown that secondhand smoke can be even more harmful to the body than smoking first-hand, and this is definitely an unfair negative externality that third parties have to endure. Health is a concern for every individual, and allowing others to compromise this is immensely undesirable. Yet, smokers do exist in every community. In their defense, there are smokers who have tried hard to quit, but have simply grown too reliant. Although this vice may not be easy for everyone to forgive, we have to recognise that these people, too, have interests that they are seeking to maximise. How, then, can we cater to the interests of both parties? I believe that it is possible to come to a degree of compromise. I propose that instead of implementing a blanket ban on smoking in all restaurants, smoking areas can be introduced. Care must be taken, however, to separate these areas sufficiently (perhaps by glass panels or the like) such that the smoke does not permeate non-smoking areas. The restaurants, then, will not lose their smoking customers or their non-smoking patrons. In this way, we can maximise the benefits to all stakeholders in question.
