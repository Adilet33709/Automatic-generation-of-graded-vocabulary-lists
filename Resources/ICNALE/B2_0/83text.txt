Smoking is widely believed to be a bad habit which will have an impact on both the smoker and the people around the smoker. In restaurants where people come to relax and feel refreshed, smoking, the selfish behavior that ruins people's appetite, raises health concerns and shows disrespect, should be completely banned. Smoking should be banned in restaurants since it ruins people's appetite. Scientific research has shown that when people say they love a dish, 70% of their joy comes from the smell of the dish instead of the taste of the dish, which means that although the food in a restaurant tastes extremely good, the smell of cigarettes can easily get mixed up with the smell of the food and ruin people's appetites. Smoking also leads to health concerns, which is why it should be banned in restaurants. People are all aware of the danger that smoking may bring. However, the danger of second-hand smoke is even worse. Smoking in restaurants is forcing so many people around the smokers to take in the second-hand smoke, which may lead to public health issues. It is not one person that the smoker has influenced but close to a hundred. For the sake of health concerns, smoking should be completely banned in restaurants. Finally, smoking in restaurants is disrespectful. In a restaurant, when a smoker is talking to his company with a cigarette in his hand, he is likely to puff the smoke right in front of his company's face. More than that, the smoke would rise and go anywhere without permission. Further, smoking in restaurants is an insult to the chef, as it suggests that the chef’s food can't satisfy them but cigarettes can. Smoking in restaurants is totally inappropriate and easily affects many people. This behavior should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
