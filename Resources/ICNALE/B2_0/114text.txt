In my opinion, I agree with completely banning smoking in all restaurants in the country. Smoking is known to be harmful to the health of smokers and of people nearby who inhale cigarette smoke. Therefore, smoking should not be allowed in restaurants, for if a restaurant does not have ventilation or an air conditioning system, the smoke will be toxic in that room and harm the health of everyone. Research has shown that people who do not smoke but inhale cigarette smoke suffer harm from it, and smoke may be more toxic in smokers than in non-smokers. This is true even for outdoor restaurants, for although the air flows, the smoke can still harm the health of people around the smoker. Thus, tobacco smoke disturbs and destroys the atmosphere around you. I think we should be campaigning for the prohibition of smoking in public places for good atmosphere and the health of everyone. Surprisingly, even smokers are already aware that smoking is not healthy at all, but they smoke all the same, probably because they think that it is cool and looks good. However, I think that smoking does not enhance the character, but looks bad. If we want to quit smoking, we would have to return to and modify our values first.
