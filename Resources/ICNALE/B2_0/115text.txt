In my opinion, smoking should be banned from all the restaurants in the Philippines. This is because restaurants were purposely designed to feed customers. They were invented mainly to serve food and drink, not to provide entertainment that may cause harm to other people. Moreover, it would be unfair to other customers if smoking in restaurants is tolerated. Others who go to restaurants to dine and those who serve at the restaurant may endure diseases caused by the inhalation of smoke produced by cigarettes. It is very dangerous to health, most especially to second-hand smokers. Second-hand smokers are those who do not directly inhale smoke but eventually digest it into their lungs. They are the ones who unintentionally inhale the smoke produced by smokers. Restaurants should not only consider profit but should also consider the effects their services might have on their customers. Their main goal should be to provide services that have good effects on their customers. Health is a lot more important than money and should be considered first before anything else. It would be better if certain industries should construct areas which are only made to serve smokers, to prevent certain diseases such as cancer from being acquired through the inhalation of smoke.
