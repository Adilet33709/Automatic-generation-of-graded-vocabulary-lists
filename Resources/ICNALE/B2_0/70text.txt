Nowadays, there has been a heated discussion about whether smoking should be banned at all the restaurants. People who smoke argue that the ban takes away their freedom. However, nonsmokers advocate it as a good rule. From my perspective, I think that smoking should be banned in all restaurants. Firstly, smoking, which will bring many diseases, does harm to our health. Besides, smoking releases much smoke into the air, which pollutes our environment. What's more, many people cannot put up with the smoke, which makes them sick. It is not surprising that banning smoking in all restaurants will promote workers’ efficiency. Therefore, it is very important and necessary to us to ban smoking in all restaurants. If one wants to smoke, he can smoke in private. My suggestion is that they should give up smoking. It is beneficial to both our health and the environment. Smoking should be banned in all restaurants. Only in this way can we breathe fresher air in the future! Today, more and more people all over the world want to give up smoking. If you're not a smoker, don't start. In fact, smoking is a bad habit, which causes great harm to people's health.
