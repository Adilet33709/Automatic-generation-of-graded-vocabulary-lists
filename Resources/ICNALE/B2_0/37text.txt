While smoking is indeed a proven health hazard not only for the smoker but also for people in the vicinity in the form of secondhand smoke, it does have its benefits and function in society. Smoking is a social activity - smokers usually do not smoke alone; they form a group that is just like any other in society around a common topic or activity that includes and excludes people. In its worst form, it can even be a form of networking, of socializing (or smoking) your way to the top, a way of getting to know people in a relaxed, accepting atmosphere of common interest. Smoking in restaurants usually takes this form and that means extended periods of smoking with a large group of people puffing away for hours on end. While it is definitely tempting to ban smoking from all restaurants, smokers are generally considerate enough not to smoke in enclosed areas, bringing most of the harmful smoke outside in the open air, usually in a labeled smoking area. Even if customers are annoyed, that should not be sufficient reason to ban a group of people, regardless of whether they are smoking or not. It would deprive them of the opportunity to eat at any restaurant in the country.
