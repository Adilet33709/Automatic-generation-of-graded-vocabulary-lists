I am going to write as a college student. First of all, yes, I agree with the statement. Doing a part time job is essential for students, and especially college students. It costs a lot to go to the university. Most college students lack both time and money in Korea. Of course it's important to earn money but all of the universities require too much money. Most students can't afford the money by themselves. Me either. I think we should go abroad or experience many things we haven't done instead of studying all day or working every day and staying at home. I insist it is important to do a part time job, but I hate how we have to do a part-time job. Anyway, we can learn many things from doing part time jobs, such as endurance, responsibility and conversation skills. I think these are much more important than the money we earn from doing part-time jobs. We can also learn how to use our time efficiently. To be at work on time, we schedule. That is how we learn to use our time. In addition, typically it's boring to do a part-time job, so I do some exercise or read a newspaper when I am free at work. You don't? But I do!
