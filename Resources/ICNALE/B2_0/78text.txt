Part-time jobs are important for college students. This statement is made based on my own reasoning. First, having a part-time job will be useful for us in the future. We can learn such skills as how to earn our own money and how to manage our income, so the time we spend working will not be wasted. Moreover, if we are from another island, our part-time job could reduce our family’s financial problems, even if just a little. Second, we must admit that sometimes the money our parents transfer to us monthly is not sufficient for our daily needs. Earning money by ourselves will be very helpful, so we will not burden our parents by asking for more money. They also cannot complain about how we are going to use it because as it is the money we earn ourselves, we have the right to manage it ourselves. Last but not least, part-time work helps us become independent. It gives us experience in handling the problems we will face in our full-time jobs in the future, and helps us learn how to socialize with our co-workers, how to be close with them, and how to handle the problems that we encounter with them. It is also easier to find a job if we have experience working for other people. For example, if we ever had a job and wanted to find a new job, our chance of being hired will be higher than for those who never had a job at all. Therefore, I conclude that having a part-time job is important for college students.
