Smoking is causing a lot of problems presently for students and adults. I bet our country is one of the places where people smoke the most. Honestly, I don't care whether they smoke or not. But students smoking? That's totally wrong. They're destroying their bodies completely before they even fully become an adult. They probably smoke because they think it makes them look cool. Yes, that is true, it does make someone who's smoking look cool. But is looking cool to other people worth more than their own health? Lots of people regret smoking when they get cancer or they make a hole through their neck. Before then, they can never realize how serious this is. Since smoking started to look cool, it's giving a really bad influence to little kids. For example, I saw kindergarten children smoking, not outside, but on the internet. They were spitting saliva out of their mouths. That's not what kids should do. If the government wanted people to make them stop smoking, why didn't they raise the price of the cigarette up to a hundred dollars? Who would dare to buy that? That would really help stop smoking. But then again, cigarettes bring a lot of profit to our land. It cigarettes become illegal to sell, our country will suffer damage in the financial losses. I guess we can't make those people who smoke stop smoking. I just hope it doesn't get worse than this.
