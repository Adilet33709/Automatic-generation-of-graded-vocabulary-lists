Despite the fact that smoking does harm to our health, as is known by almost everyone, there are still many people who keep smoking every day. They often light a cigarette in any place they like, especially in public situations, such as restaurants and so on. I feel really uncomfortable while a person is smoking close to me. Accordingly, I suggest that smoking should be mainly banned at all restaurants in the country. The reasons are as follows. First of all, as is mentioned above, smoking is really harmful to smokers' health and that of the people around them as well. A number of research reports indicate that heavy smoking is likely to lead to lung cancer, which is a deadly disease for human beings. Banning smoking at restaurants is an effective way to control people’s smoking habits more or less. What's more, if there is no one smoking at restaurants, other customers can enjoy their meals with pleasure in a comfortable environment. In this way, customers may feel relaxed and have good appetites, which will stimulate the income of restaurants. Nevertheless, if some smokers can't bear this rule, we can set up a smoking room for them to smoke in. This room must be sealed in case other customers will be troubled by the smoke. These are my general ideas of banning smoking at all restaurants in the country. I can safely draw the conclusion that this decision will bring us more good than harm, so we should appeal to our friends to support it.
