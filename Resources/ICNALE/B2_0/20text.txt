I disagree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part time job. While it is true that college tuition fees are high these days, scholarships and loans are being offered, too. I believe that this discussion has to take into account the idea of 'opportunity cost'. Take, for example, the case of a student who is deciding whether or not to work to support his studies or to spend more time studying to obtain a better result. The student has the option of working harder and spending more time studying to obtain a scholarship for his studies. The scholarship could solve the student's financial problems in addition to getting excellent results. I believe that this is an issue of investment of time. Students who do part time jobs are generally tired when they attend classes. This could affect their studies indirectly. A person could choose, instead, to invest his or her time on studies while applying for a loan to support their tuition fees. Being able to pay their tuition fees by working part time and being tired or sleepy in classes is not a good option. By doing the comparison, spending more time on studies, thus getting better results, and obtaining a scholarship is a better one. In conclusion, the statement that it is important for college students to have a part time job should be discarded as it is not a viable alternative of solving a person's financial constraint problems. It is not wise for a student to forgo his studies to support his or her school tuition fees.
