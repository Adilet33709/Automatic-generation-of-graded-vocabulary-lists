Having a part-time job is a good thing for students. It can not only make students gain work experience but it can also make them more independent. But for me, having a part-time job isn't very important. Nowadays, more and more college students have part-time jobs. When the class ends, students usually say that they are going to work. They work so hard that they don't have time to relax. Because of the work, when friends ask them to go shopping, they always turn them down. If you are always absent, friends will not invite you next time and you will become lonely. Besides, many students who have jobs after class often finish late. When they get home, they don't have the energy to review their homework, which makes them get lower grades in the class. Furthermore, because they are out of energy, some of them even sleep during the class. It's not worth it if you get lonely and get bad grades just because of the work. Before you get a job, you should take care of your schoolwork. Students should behave as students. Thus, I don't think it is very important for college students to get part-time jobs.
