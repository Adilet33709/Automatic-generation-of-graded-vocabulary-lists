I agree with this statement. I have two reasons to support my opinion. Firstly, to ban smoking at all restaurants, people who do not smoke can be guarded from smoke-filled air. Recently in Japan, more and more restaurants have separate smoking and non-smoking sections, and at most restaurants, you can choose the section where you sit. However, there are still some problems. Firstly, there is still high possibility for non-smokers to breathe smoke. For example, non-smokers cannot choose a non-smoking seat if the section is full. In this case, they have to take seats in the smoking section, and they automatically breathe smoke. Also, just separating the sections cannot completely prevent non-smokers from breathing smoke. Even if smoking and non-smoking sections are separate, the two of them are still in the same restaurant. Thus, non-smokers are not perfectly guarded from smoke-filled air. In addition, clerks should also be considered. Even if there are separate smoking and non-smoking sections in a restaurant, it does not help the clerks. Therefore, the clerks cannot be guarded from smoke. Secondly, banning smoking at restaurants helps smokers to try to stop smoking. If smoking is not accepted at restaurants, smokers cannot smoke at restaurants. I think it makes smokers think about trying to stop smoking. It is very good for their health to stop smoking. For these two reasons, I agree with this statement.
