During celebrations, simple gatherings, occasions, or even just to satisfy a craving people go to eat at restaurants. Many people enjoy being at restaurants, even simple restaurants will do, as long as they have the time and opportunity to dine out with special people. When in a public place, there are also things that one should do, like respect the management of the restaurant and its facilities, as well as the other customers. However, some people tend to do things that offend other people without knowing it. For example, when some customers smoke inside a restaurant, many people are affected by the smoke that they exhale. The smoker not only affects the people within or near their occupied table, but all of the people that are dining inside. Second-hand smoke: the smoke that the smoker exhales and other people inhales, is very dangerous because it contains carbon monoxide and other gaseous toxins that have adverse effects on our body. Even when smokers smoke outside, it still affects other customers that are trying to enjoy and unwind with the food and ambience of the restaurant. Smoking not only disturbs the customers but it also poses a threat to the smoker as well, as it contains harmful gases that damage their system. Smoking in restaurants should be banned in the country to save peoples’ right to enjoy the food and ambience offered by the place, and to not be exposed to the cancerous smoke exhaled by a selfish customer.
