I agree with the statement. According to the news on the Korean TV, smokers cannot smoke in public areas from 2013. I have four reasons for supporting the statement. First of all, if smokers smoke in restaurants, they influence other customers. Suppose other customers in the restaurant eating some food and smokers are smoking next to their table. The customers really do not like smell and it is disgusting. I think it is not good smoking in public areas. Second, smoking is not good for our health. According to a newspaper I saw, smoking damages smokers' lungs and they cannot live as long as non-smokers. Smoking take a toll on the lungs and prompts cancer of the lungs and lots of other disease. Third, if smokers are smoking in restaurants, other non-smokers are damaged from smokers. I am referring to second-hand smoking. I read some result of the second-hand smoking. It said that non-smokers are damaged if they smell tobacco. I was surprised about that result. The last reason not to allow smoking in restaurants is I think the most important thing in a restaurant is cleanliness. If smokers are smoking in the restaurant, lots of places in the store are dirtier than in a non-smoking restaurant because smoking makes the place dirty. Finally, I think smoking must be banned in restaurants.
