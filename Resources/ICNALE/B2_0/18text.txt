Smoking has always been an issue in our society - inflation of cigarettes, smoking areas, secondhand smoke, etc. All over the world people seem to be quitting smoking. One of the ways this has happened is increasing the cost of cigarettes. In South Korea this issue has been talked about a lot, but does not seem to be working. Recently the cost of Dunhill brand cigarettes has been raised to reduce the rate of smoking, but people who smoked Dunhills changed their brand to a cheaper brand. Secondly, smoking areas are not appointed well, which causes people to smoke in bus stops, inside buildings, and in public areas. In Canada, it is illegal to smoke inside buildings and in public areas. This should be put into action in Korea. And the last issue is secondhand smoking. This issue is related to the smoking area issue. I guess most people know that secondhand smoking is worse than smoking, and secondhand smoking can cause cancer and skin disease. A person I knew from my youth was healthy but she died from lung cancer from secondhand smoking; her husband was a chain smoker. I do not smoke in public areas because I know secondhand smoke is bad and I do not like the way the people see me. Smoking has always been an issue in our society.
