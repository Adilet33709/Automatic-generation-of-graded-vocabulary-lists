I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking is bad for not just the smoker’s health but also the health of people around them. At restaurants, diners have the right to fully enjoy their dining experience. If smoking is not completely banned, many diners will either have to suffer in silence and be engulfed in the smoke or to choose an alternative place to dine at. The reason it should be completely banned and not partially or fully unbanned is simple: smoke can diffuse easily in air, which can spread to a much further location from the point where the smoker is. The foul smoke from the smoker can easily affect many tables around them. Even with demarcation for smokers, the smoke does not restrict itself from spreading to non-demarcated areas. Thus, other non-smoking diners will still be able to smell the smoke. Another reason for banning smoking is that it encourages smokers to quit smoking. With fewer places to smoke, it will make smoking more inconvenient and can have a positive effect on smokers. Some may argue that smokers have the right to do what they want, but if this right infringes on others who have the right to fresh air, the smokers should just give in. It is also inconsiderate for smokers to pollute the air, especially if the restaurant is air-conditioned, which slows the dissipation of the foul smell. Therefore, for the above reasons, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country.
