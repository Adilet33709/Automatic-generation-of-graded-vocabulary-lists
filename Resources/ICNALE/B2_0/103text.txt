Imagine that you are having a romantic dinner with your spouse at a restaurant with nice ambiance and the tempting aroma of food, when all of a sudden you catch a whiff of pungent cigarette smoke from the table next to you. Will that affect your enjoyment of your dinner? For me, it most definitely would, and thus I agree that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants, for two main reasons. First, second-hand cigarette smoke has been found to be extremely harmful, and is even more harmful to innocent passers-by than to the smokers themselves. This means that smokers are actually bringing harm upon others when the smoke they exhale gets inhaled by the people around them. Would you want to enter a restaurant where you cannot breathe without inhaling all the poisonous fumes from other patrons' smoking? Most likely not, and therefore for the sake of their customers, restaurants should prohibit smoking within their premises. Second, smoking does not fit in well with the ambiance that restaurants aim to provide their patrons. What we associate with smoking is the image of a slightly unkempt person in shorts and slippers and horrible-smelling breath; in other words, highly unappealing. On the other hand, restaurants are portrayed as high-class with delicious food. Thus, for the sake of their business, smoking should be banned so as to preserve their image. In conclusion, smoking should be banned in all restaurants, as it will benefit both the restaurant and the patrons.
