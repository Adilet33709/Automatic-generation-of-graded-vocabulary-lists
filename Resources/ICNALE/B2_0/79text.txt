It is well known that smoking causes harm to the body, especially respiratory cancer, but it does not stop people smoking. According to the statistics shown on the government's webpage, there were 839,900 smokers in Hong Kong in 2006, accounting for 14.8% of Hong Kong’s residents aged 15 and over. In addition, due to criticism from activists, Hong Kong’s government can hardly legislate prohibiting smoking in Hong Kong, because it is also against people’s human rights. Smokers claim that they have the right and freedom to smoke. To avoid the term “freedom” from being abused, it is necessary to define what freedom means. Freedom, by dictionary definition, is the state of being free. However, does it really mean there is no limit or restriction? Freedom of one should be based on ensuring that it has no effect on others, i.e., smokers should consider whether there is anyone nearby who does not want to passively smoke. I hate smoking and cigarettes, but I do not agree that smoking should be completely prohibited at all restaurants. However, I think it is better to set up distinct smoking and non-smoking areas in a restaurant. It could be a win-win situation for both smokers and non-smokers.
