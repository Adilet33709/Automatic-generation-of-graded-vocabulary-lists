I think that it is important for college students to have a part time job. The reason is that they can learn a lot of things which are very important but which are not taught in schools. For example, they can learn how to build a good relationship between colleagues or their  boss. Whatever part time work you may be doing, it is usual that you need to cooperate with others to work. Through this kind of cooperation, they can learn what is important to make relations with colleagues or bosses better. In my case, I teach English to high school students in a cram school as a part time job. Through the experience of cooperating with other teachers and teaching students, I realized how important it is to mutually communicate with people. Another example is that they can grow a respectable attitude towards money. Through working hard and then getting money as a salary, they may realize that getting money requires hard work and how important money is. This also applies to me. Before I started to work as a part time teacher, I thought that money was something that was given by my parents for free but now I think that money needs labor and time. In conclusion, a part time job can teach many important things to students. Therefore, college students should have a part time job.
