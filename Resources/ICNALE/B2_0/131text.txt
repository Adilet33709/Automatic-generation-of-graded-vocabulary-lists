"No smoking". This is a sign that we can see everywhere. Ironically, we can also see many people smoking freely. Definitely, smoking is the issue in our country and the world. These days many countries ban smoking in official places and in other places. In Korea, we also ban smoking in many places, but I think smokers don't care about this rule. I really don't like the smell of smoking, so if someone smokes in the street my face is going to be frowning. I insist that we should make some rules like smokers have to smoke in restricted areas. It is a very great idea, I think. Many non-smokers are bothered because of smoking. It is very harmful to people's health and to our habitat. Cigarettes contain very toxic material, so people can't quit easily. I think that cigarette companies should increase cigarette prices, and then many people can quit their smoking habit more easily. It is a good idea that advertisers make many ads about not smoking. I hope many smokers can quit their smoking habit so other people can be safe everywhere and all the time. I don't know well how hard it is for smokers to quit smoking because I'm not a smoker. Although it is very hard to quit smoking, you should quit as soon as possible for your health. Maybe you can ask a doctor how to quit your smoking habit if you really want to quit your smoking habit.
