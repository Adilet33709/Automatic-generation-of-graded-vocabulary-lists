Whether smoking should be banned at all restaurants has become a controversial issue, arousing great public concern. Personally, I think it is important to ban smoking at restaurants and that we should not allow this condition in restaurants anymore. First and foremost, there's no denying that smoking does harm to smokers and others in the meantime. Although some people are addicted to smoking, they are supposed to pay more attention to the health of others in public. Moreover, it is commonly believed that smoking destroys the elegant atmosphere in the restaurant. Non-smokers don't want to get harmed by cigarette smoke in restaurants. They come to the restaurants to have meals in happiness. Therefore, I suggest that the government should create a place especially for the smokers and the problem will be solved gradually. Last but not least, educated as most Chinese people are, it is crucial for us to behave formally and gently in public. In summary, taking many factors into consideration, I hope that this phenomenon will disappear after the struggles of so many people. Besides, our government had better take actions to protect the environment at restaurants and solve the problem as soon as possible.
