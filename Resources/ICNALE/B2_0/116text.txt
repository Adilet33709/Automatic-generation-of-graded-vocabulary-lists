Smoking is never a good thing for many people, especially in public places such as restaurants. First, the smell of cigarettes fills the air and mixes with the smell of food. People will lose their appetite if their food smells like cigarettes or if they cannot smell their meal because of cigarette smoke. Moreover, some smokers do not have any respect for other customers; they blow smoke right from their mouths into others’ faces or throw ashes on the floor or their plates. Second, many people avoid restaurants filled with smokers, especially if they have their children with them. It is uncomfortable to eat while worrying about their children's health since it is easier for children to suffer the effects of secondhand smoke. The first two factors could affect the income of restaurants and cause a great deal of loss. Finally, there are many people in a restaurant who will inhale secondhand smoke, which is dangerous because secondhand smokers can contract lung cancer and many other infections much more easily than smokers themselves. Moreover, these victims include not only guests but workers and passersby. Overall, smoking should be forbidden in restaurants and smokers should be seated in an isolated room.
