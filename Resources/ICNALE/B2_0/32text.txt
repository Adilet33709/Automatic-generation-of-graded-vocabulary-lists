Nowadays, it is very common for university students to have a part-time job while they are studying. Tutoring is one of the popular jobs that they often choose. However, why are so many students spending their time doing a part-time job rather than using the time to study? What is the importance of doing a part-time job? Experience is one of the benefits university students want to gain by doing a part-time job. In today's society, work experience is required, and for a fresh graduate of a university, part-time jobs are the only method to gain experience. Money is also one of the reasons that students get a part-time job. In Hong Kong, the university school fees are around 42,000 Hong Kong dollars per year. Even though the government has already paid much of it for us, it is still a large amount of money for a normal family. Besides, students have to spend the money on things such as meals and transport. If students have a part-time job, it can lighten the financial pressure on their families. Some people are against this statement since they think the students’ academic results might be affected a part-time job. It is a shame because the time available for revision must decrease. However, it also provides a chance for students to practice their time management skills. If the students manage their time in an intelligent way, it will be easy to ensure a good academic result. No pain, no gain. In this case, what we need to do is use the least pain for the maximum gain. A part-time job for university students is a good example of it. Therefore, I agree that it is important for university students to have a part-time job.
