Today, people live in a fast-paced society. People need to survive and cope with new environments every now and then. One noted term that one must always remember is “practicality”. Even if one faces a new world and begins a new chapter, one must always consider living practically. In Filipino communities, many families find it difficult to sustain their financial needs and can ill-afford to send their children to college. Yet these students are very eager to continue their college studies, to work, to earn, and to aspire for a more comfortable life. These college students work part-time jobs to assist and finance their studies. These part-time jobs are offered to students by various business and companies, a few of which are: crew members in fast-food chains, assistant librarians, and cashiers at a grocery store. Having a part-time job while studying is a really tedious task and involves the wise use of your time. Truly, working while studying and studying while working is a real sacrifice; one must sacrifice his/her free time and rest to work and study. Yet, at the end of the day it will be beneficial – he/she will finish his/her degree and have better opportunities to be employed. All this hard work will be compensated and they will be able to help others as well. Having been employed from an early age is not a disadvantage, it also gives the edge to these working students as they have hands-on experience at these jobs. Such students are able to learn and understand the flow of the business or organization that they work for. They will also have gained an additional network for their social life and, most importantly, they will have the money they need, gained from their own hard work.
