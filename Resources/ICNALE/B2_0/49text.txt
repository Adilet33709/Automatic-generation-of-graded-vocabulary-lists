Science tells us that smoking is dangerous. The contents of cigarettes are such that they can cause permanent lung damage or worse, lung cancer. This is because cigarettes contain dangerous chemicals that damage the lungs permanently. Some scientists even say that one of these chemicals is used in rocket fuel. Yet smoking poses even greater threats to other individuals in the proximity of the smoker. This is what we call third-hand or third party smoking. Why is this more dangerous? It is because the smoke that comes out of the cigarette is more impure than that inhaled by the smoker. This is why the risk it poses increases exponentially. This is also the reason why I think smoking should be banned in all restaurants. I have two reasons why the risk of endangering individuals will increase if we continue to let smoking happen. One, these are public places, places where a lot of individuals gather to eat. Even if we say that there are smoking areas, the mere proximity of the smoker could have third-hand smoking effects. Second, people can just go to private bathrooms or more secluded areas to smoke. It is only in these private spots that we can be sure that they are not harming other people in the process of engaging in their bad habit. The state has the imperative to ban smoking, precisely because public health is concerned here. They have a moral obligation to the people because their quality of life deteriorates every second that they inhale third-hand smoke. Just because smokers have the right to smoke themselves to death, they should not include other individuals in this process.
