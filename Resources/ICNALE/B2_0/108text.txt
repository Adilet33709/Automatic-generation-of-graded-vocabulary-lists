God has sent us into this world for a great purpose. Our holy prophet (PBUH), whose tasks included teaching and learning, was also sent for such a purpose. In the beginning, it was very easy to obtain knowledge, but with the passage of time, it has become very difficult to do so. This is due to the increased expenses of study. Although people face many problems in earning money, and it is very difficult for them to make a living, as this is an age of science and technology, everybody wants to receive more education. However, due to the low income of their parents and other difficult circumstances, they have to work part-time to meet their expenses, which is why many students work part-time during their studies even though it is difficult for them to manage two tiresome tasks. By being compelled to work part-time, their adverse circumstances teach them many things during their studies and they become mature at an early age. Indeed, some students have to work very hard, which leaves them exhausted and unable to study properly. However, they regret being unable to pay full attention to their studies. As time passes, the costs of studies are increasing; unfortunately, our government is not taking actions to remedy this. The government should establish some system of relief for students in school, or at least provide suitable jobs that are not very difficult. It should not be a system that leads people to become students just to obtain money and then intentionally neglect their studies or leave them incomplete.
