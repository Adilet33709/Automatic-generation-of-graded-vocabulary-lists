Should smoking be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country? Yes, it should. Some smokers may feel that their freedom to smoke will be limited, but smoking in public places, especially in restaurants, may give rise to some problems. It is widely accepted that smoking does harm to our health. Smoking can increase the possibility of catching some cancers. According to some international surveys, the number of people who die of cancers related to smoking has increased rapidly over the years. What's more, smoking influences not only the health of smokers, but also that of second-hand smokers. The ban on smoking at all the restaurants can certainly reduce the effects of second-hand smoking. In this way, it is a quite reasonable rule that all customers should obey. To ban smoking in restaurants can also help educate teenagers. As we all know, the number of teenagers who smoke has been rising rapidly. Instead of telling the children that it is not a good habit to smoke, the non-smoking signs in restaurants can lead the children to recognize the dangers more easily. Of course, it is of great significance for a successful restaurant to keep a clean and comfortable atmosphere. Customers may feel uncomfortable and uneasy when exposed to smoke in restaurants. How can a restaurant provide satisfactory service to its customers when the customers feel a sense of not being at home? After all, restaurants are public places in which to eat and enjoy ourselves. Smoke can easily affect the quality of a restaurant's services. Given these reasons, we can now draw the conclusion that the ban on smoking at all the restaurants is reasonable and necessary.
