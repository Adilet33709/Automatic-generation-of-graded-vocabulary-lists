Smoking refers to smoking a cigarette or cigar. In today’s world, the number of smokers is continuously increasing, including people of different ages and genders. Under our beliefs, reliance on any addiction to drugs or tobacco is haram. The harmful effects of smoking and its symptoms have also been demonstrated. According to research, if a person smoked 20 cigarettes a day continuously, in a few year he would have lung cancer. Our teenagers are becoming addicted to smoking by watching TV shows and films of our surroundings, and some are doing this just for fashion, but unconsciously they are slowly killing themselves. According to surveys, most adults smoke cigarettes to relieve tension, as it relaxes the brain. Therefore, you cannot even work properly. Students or teens start to smoke after watching their parents or people around them, and some consider it a fashion. However, smoking simply wastes money and destroys health. It causes many lung diseases and breathing problems as the lungs became black and dry from the smoke. In women, it can cause chest cancer. Smoking advertisements should be banned by the government to help prevent our upcoming generation from taking up such a waste of money and health. Moreover, the Ministry of Health should require messages to be placed on cigarette packages stating that smoking is injurious to the health. Finally, smoking can lead to other sins and harder drugs, which not only affect their lives but also their families and society. We must make it easy to say no to smoking and drugs.
