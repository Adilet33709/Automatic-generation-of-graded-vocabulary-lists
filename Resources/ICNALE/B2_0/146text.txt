Smoking can decrease the sensations of eating. Cigarette smoke blows into your face and enters your throat. Is this situation going to make meals worthless? I think everyone will give the same answer because no one wants to have a meal with tobacco smoke. It also causes air pollution that affects the lungs when inhaled. People who hate smoking will have bad memories of the restaurant, and after they come once and have a bad memory, they will surely not return a second time. Now imagine that this story happens every day, even if just once a day. How can this restaurant survive? No restaurant can survive without customer satisfaction This will thus cause long-term effects because customers will come to this restaurant less and less until there are no customers. Cigarette smoking is not only a disadvantage, but also its smell is unpleasant. Can you imagine the smell of burning tobacco and food in front of your face? This would not make the food more delicious. Cigarettes can also cause accidents in children. For example, when you go inside the restaurant, you will see children running around, and as we all know, children are usually careless. They may run into a cigarette and get hurt by a burning cigarette. Even though the accident is not its fault, most parents usually blame the restaurant. As you can see from this disadvantage, we can say that smoking in restaurants has many bad sides. Moreover, there is no advantage in this situation. Therefore, we should not have to hesitate to ban smoking in all restaurants in the country.
