Lots of problems exist in part-time jobs. I would like to discuss low wages, behavior of superiors, and the absence of break time during work. I have done part time job in Korea, and when I was working these three problems caused me lots of stress. When I was at work the manager treated me badly. He swore at me and shouted at me in front of people. At work, break time was not guaranteed. If the manager saw me moving slowly he would tell me to walk faster or to run. Of course the wage was not so good and I didn't get paid on time. Regarding the behavior of managers or superiors at work, I heard bad news more than good news. In my case, as I said, the manager used to swear at part-time staff. This problem should be fixed as soon as possible, because part-time workers are people, too. They do not deserve that kind of treatment. My opinion is that the relationship between part-time workers and superiors should be improved for good. The second problem is that break time is not guaranteed. Humans require food, sleep, etc. to live, but at the part-time job employers want workers to work until their shift is done. That might increase profits, but it is a good way to lose people.
