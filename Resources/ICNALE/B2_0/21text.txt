Many college students have experiences of doing part-time jobs. Some of them even spend most of their leisure time doing part-time jobs. I think doing part-time jobs is really important for college students because they can learn what they can't get from school. For example, they broaden their fields of vision by having more chances to get along with different people. Second, they learn to have sense of responsibility by taking charge of their tasks. Third, they make friends with people from different places, which makes their college time more interesting and substantial. Nevertheless, college students can't have a part-time job if they cannot concentrate on their studies. Although I think that having the experiences of part-time jobs is important, learning from their studies is the most important thing for college students. If students spend most of their time doing a part-time job, they will miss the chance to enjoy campus life and make precious memories. To make matters worse, they may fail their examinations. To sum up, college students should first do their best in their studies, and they should participate in activities in school, like clubs. Experiences of clubs are useful for improving abilities of leadership, and are thus helpful for applying jobs after graduating. Only if they still have time should they have a part-time job while enjoying their college life.
