I agree with the statement. I have four reasons. First of all, I think it is important for university students to gain experience before getting a job. For example, if students who have finished university get a job and have to work hard, they cannot work effectively because they have not enough experience. In university, no one teaches executive abilities. Second, lots of Korean students do not know the value of money since lots of Korean university students get pocket money from their parents. I think people who have never experienced part-time jobs do not know the value of money. Third, having a part-time job allows students to know about spending money. I think a lot of students do not have experience working in a part-time job and they do not know how to manage spending money because they have never experienced working and earning the money themselves. Because of this, it is a good experience for a university student to work in a part time job. The last thing is that they can get to know lots of people. If students work part-time jobs, they can get to know a lot of workers other than general university students. In Korea, it is important to know the people who are in the same field. Consequentially, I agree with working part-time jobs for university students.
