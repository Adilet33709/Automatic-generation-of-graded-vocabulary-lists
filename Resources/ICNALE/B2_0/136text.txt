Personally, I am for the ban on cigarette smoking in all restaurants across the country. Smoking has various negative effects. Second-hand smokers or those who inhale smoke from those who smoke cigarettes, are the ones who are more prone to the negative effects of smoking. The cigarettes smoked by cigarette smokers have filters which make the smoke less bad than the smoke second-hand smokers inhale. Inhaling smoke or the smoking act itself can trigger certain diseases. The deadliest disease that is possible to develop is lung cancer. I have been to a museum where a section showcased lungs at different stages of lung cancer. I saw how black the lungs where, even when the cancer had been present for only 3 to 6 months. At the end of the cycle of the cancer, I saw how regular sized lungs shrink to a size smaller than an orange. On the other side of the table, if the ban is passed into a law, the companies who manufacture cigarettes will lose profits and may latter become bankrupt. Banning the smoking of cigarettes only focusing on the health of the citizen may be inconsiderate as we do not consider the other side of the table which benefits from cigarettes. To sum, I am for the ban of smoking though I consider the side of the manufactures as well. It would be extremely beneficial if the ones living under the ban will examine and closely weigh the pros and cons before possibly passing the ban for smoking.
