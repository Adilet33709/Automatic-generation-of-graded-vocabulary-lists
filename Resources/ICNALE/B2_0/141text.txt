Previous arguments have always focused on the necessity of college students having a part-time job. With higher levels of awareness of the benefits of having a part-time job, more people are encouraging their children to acquire one during university. In today's society, a part-time job is becoming necessary in a college student's life. Money is needed now more than ever. A number of teenagers are entering the workforce. The modern times in which we live accommodate the need of teenagers to have their own source of income. A part-time job not only enables students to promote their abilities, but also helps them to apply their knowledge into practice. Furthermore, students who have part-time jobs can relieve the financial burdens of their parents. Studies should remain the main focus of students, but if they have the chance, they should earn some money and gain experience while they're in school. In my opinion, students can choose to take up a part-time job according to their own situations. The most important thing for them is to keep a good balance between part-time jobs and their studies. Taking advantage of a part-time job during college is practical. Thus, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job, if they can handle it properly.
