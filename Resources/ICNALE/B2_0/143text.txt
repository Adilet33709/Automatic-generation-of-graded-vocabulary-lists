I wholeheartedly agree that smoking should be banned from all restaurants across the entire country. Of all the places to smoke, why at a restaurant anyway? First and foremost, smoking has never done anything good for anyone. Nobody benefits from smoking. So why bother then? The smoke, the smell, all of it is hazardous to the health of the smoker and even more so to those who inhale the smoke second-hand. Moreover, smoking just contributes even more to the already polluted air around us. Second, since cleanliness in restaurants should always be maintained, there is no reason not to kick-out smokers. In addition, it is important to eat clean food, especially since doing otherwise may result in sicknesses, stomach aches, and the like. Smoking in restaurants simply spreads the dust, and other dirty particles all over the place. Third, there are many people around with asthma or allergies to dust. Smokers can unintentionally blow on the face of these people and cause unwanted accidents or attacks. Who knows? Besides, whether with asthma or without, I am sure no one likes walking into a cloud of smoke at a restaurant, or anywhere for that matter, and getting the full blast of pollution right in their faces. No one would want their children to experience that just before entering a restaurant. People would rather eat in smoke-free restaurants anyway, so it is better to ban smoking or even just to increase the cost. On the whole, banning smoking would be for the benefit of the restaurant and the consumers.
