Part-time jobs motivate people to work. These people do not waste time; therefore, they also remain healthy. With part-time jobs, people remain busy working, so they build their national attitude and a strong country. Our leader, Quid-e-Azam, said to do our work so that we do not have so much time to criticize. Moreover, by working part-time, you can make yourself able to help others with money, with their work, and with their troubles. People often work part-time to earn money for their families. In Pakistan, all people remain free and do nothing instead of criticizing others; therefore, a part-time job is a necessary part of life to keep busy and not criticize others. This would be helpful to their country. However, a part-time job is tiresome, and to some extent, part-time jobs incur losses. People working part-time suffer from mental and physical distortions and fatigue, and if they work too much, they may make themselves ill. While this is negative, however, it is also true of regular jobs. Mental tension is created through studying and teaching simultaneously. Thus, part-time jobs have both positive and negative points.
