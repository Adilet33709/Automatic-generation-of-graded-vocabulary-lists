Personally, I believe that a part-time job is necessary and enormously helpful for college students, especially for junior or senior students. By undertaking a part-time job, we can gain at least three major advantages. First and foremost, through certain kinds of part-time jobs, our knowledge fields are extended and our horizons are broadened. For instance, if a student majoring in engineering works as a marketing intern during his vacation, he can gain more knowledge in business management. Such practice is of much significance to the overall development of a future talent. Secondly, the experience of internship helps students a lot in dealing with various cases and communicating with people from all areas. Staying at school, students interact frequently with fellow students and professors, but they are only a small part of the whole society. By going out of the school and immersing ourselves within a complex enterprise, we are urged to approach and meet our supervisor and boss, who are usually successful and competent in their own fields. They can be good mentors for our future career development. In addition, by working part-time, students can earn some money, which alleviates the financial burden of their family. College students are mature enough to be financially independent. To sum up, taking a part-time job benefits students on many levels, and it must be a good choice for us when arranging our holiday schedules.
