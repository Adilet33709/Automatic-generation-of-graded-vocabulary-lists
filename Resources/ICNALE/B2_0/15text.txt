I agree with this statement. In my opinion, there are two big reasons. Firstly, we can get money. College students need a lot of money for many things. For me, it's really important to go out with friends and go shopping, go to stylish cafés, and drink. I can't survive without money from my part time job. Some people get money from their parents, but I don't want to bother my parents. They already pay for my school and rent, it costs a lot. I think I have to earn money for my amusement by myself. Another reason is that we can get valuable experiences. We meet new people and learn about customer service, how difficult or hard it is to get money before we graduate school. I could thank my parents as I knew how to make money and how hard it is. Also, I learned about the service manners which would be useful when I get a job. Of course studying is the most important things for students, but we won't be able to get this kind of experience in university. I think experiences from a part time job is as value as classes in school. That's why I agree with having a part time job.
