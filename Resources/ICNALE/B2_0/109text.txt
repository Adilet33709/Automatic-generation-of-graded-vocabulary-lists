Although some people think that smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country; I hold a different opinion on this issue. First, everybody knows that smoking is not only bad for those who smoke, but also for those who do not smoke. This is very unfair for those who do not smoke. They do not like the smell of smoke, but they still have to bear it and their health conditions are affected. The only way to protect those who do not smoke is by totally banning smoking at all the restaurants in the country. Second, more people's lives will be saved by doing so. My grandfather did not smoke at all, but he died of lung cancer because many of his friends smoked. If this law had come earlier, many people would not have died of lung cancer. Third, restaurants are places for people to have meals instead of smoking. Those who smoke should not come to restaurants to smoke. If they want to smoke, they should go to a smoking area. In conclusion, since a lot of surveys have already pointed out that smoking is bad for people's health, we should have strict laws to restrict this bad thing, or more people will die from second-hand smoke.
