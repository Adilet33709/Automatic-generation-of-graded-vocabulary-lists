I disagree with the idea that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. Even though smoking is harmful to people who smoke, and also to people who don't smoke but are around, I think we should still respect the smokers' needs. To explain it in a simple way, people gain happiness through different ways. It just happens to be a harmful way for the smokers to gain happiness. It may urge them to quit smoking if the government practices the ban, but to those who haven't succeeded in quitting, it could be torture if they can't find a place where smoking is allowed except their homes, and it might cause further problems. There should be a substitute plan: Smoking should be banned at common restaurants, except for those with smoking areas set apart from non-smoking areas. Second, the number of restaurants with smoking areas should be limited. Third, any violation of the rules should be heavily-fined. The government should put more effort on educating people, preventing the non-smokers from starting to smoke, and providing help for the smokers to quit smoking before implementing such strict legislation. It is important for the government to think of a proper policy that makes both the smokers and non-smokers better off.
