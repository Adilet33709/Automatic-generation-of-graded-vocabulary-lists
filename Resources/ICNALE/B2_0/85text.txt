Having a part-time job as a college student can be either a burden or a benefit. It all depends on the students' willingness and openness in welcoming the job or not. It is never said that college students should be working part-time and I can confirm that both my parents are very against the idea. In many ways, working part-time is very time-consuming. It will take a large portion of time away from the students' already hectic life. Students would have to juggle study and work which will definitely result in poor grades. Having to work part-time during my holidays proves my point in that it is never easy to balance between even just work and play; so how to include studying? Partaking in a part-time job to some is a double-edged sword. For some, it is necessary. Poverty-stricken students need to work to pay college fees while others see it as an opportunity to get first-hand experience of work life after graduation as an adult. Hence, I disagree that it is important for college students to hold a part-time job while studying to a certain extent. A student’s job is to study, unless there is a compelling reason to work such as being exposed to a golden opportunity for learning. In contrast, I think that high school students should get a part-time job instead, because the workload they have is much lighter and they don’t have internships, which college students get to have.
