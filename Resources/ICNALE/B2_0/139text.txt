I agree with the statement that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. I'm going to write why I think this way by comparing the advantages and disadvantages of the situation. Now, imagine that all the restaurants in the country ban smoking. As many of you know, smoking gives us nothing good, especially when it came to medical field. Tobacco smoke contains a lot of chemicals and some of them cause lung cancer. In addition, it has turned out that the smoke does more harm to those who are around the smoker than it does to the smoker himself. Therefore, if there's nobody to smoke in a restaurant, it means that nobody is exposed to the danger of taking the harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke. I think this is an advantage of banning smoking in restaurants. Some people might want to smoke, even in restaurants. Those people might not come to restaurants as they used to do, since they are never allowed to smoke in the restaurants. Decreasing the number of the customers can affect the financial state of restaurants, and have a negative economic influence. This is a disadvantage of banning smoking in restaurants. It is true that some people can feel that they cannot do without cigarettes. However, I think such people are already addicted to smoking. What they should do is not smoke in a restaurant and risk the health of both other people's and theirs; they should consult their doctor. In the first place, restaurant should be a place where people enjoy their meals. Therefore, I think banning smoking at all the restaurants in the country is really a good idea.
