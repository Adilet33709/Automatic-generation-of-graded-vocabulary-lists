A part-time job is an inevitable part in my college days. Since I started studying at university, I have taken many kinds of jobs from a waitress to a tutor. There are so many jobs I have done that sometimes I can't remember all of them. There are several reasons why I took so many part-time jobs and what part-time jobs mean for me. First, I have to earn my own living. Since my family doesn't have the ability to support all of my life expenses, I have to make some money to support my own life. Therefore, I took many jobs to earn enough money for my life. Second, I can have different experiences and learn some things from taking different jobs. Since I have done many kinds of jobs, I have learned different experiences from them. For example, I learned how to cope with the students I tutor and I have learned some teaching skills. I also learned how to treat customers in a suitable way when I was a waitress. These experiences are really meaningful for me. The last reason is that I can make different kinds of friends from different jobs, and it's really interesting to have some chats during work time. Part-time jobs take up a great part of my college life. Even though I feel tired or frustrated because of them, I believe that I have learned a lot and matured from these experiences. Therefore, I really can't imagine what my college life would be like if I hadn't done a part time job.
