Ideally, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. By doing this, there will be many benefits to most of society. Banning smoking in restaurants would encourage more smokers to quit their smoking habit since they would have a hard time finding a place to have a cigarette. Additionally, a smoking ban will encourage a healthier environment in restaurants, since there will not be any second-hand smoke inhaled by customers. This is especially important for family-friendly restaurants with children, since children are at a higher risk of being affected by secondhand smoke. However, I feel that it is impractical for smoking to be banned at all restaurants. Smokers would feel that they are not being given the space to smoke and would feel discriminated against with such policies. Additionally, restaurant owners may not be happy with such a rule because it could drive away customers who are smokers from frequenting their restaurant. Therefore, while it is ideal that smoking be banned from all the restaurants, it is not practical to do so, especially when smokers account for quite a percentage of society. I believe the type of restaurant should determine if smoking were to be banned or not.
