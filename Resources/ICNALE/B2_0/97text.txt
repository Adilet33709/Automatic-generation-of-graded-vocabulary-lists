Having a part-time job while one is a student can be beneficial. First, students are able to earn some money by their own effort. Second, it does not take up too much responsibility or time, and in ideal situations will not distract too much from the student’s main occupation as a student. Moreover, students can make friends in their working circle and understand how to navigate the working world after graduation. Many students take up tutoring assignments which are ad-hoc and easy to manage around their time-table, while others seek jobs during the weekends or at night after their lessons. Part-time jobs are usually popular with people who have other more serious commitments, but have some spare time in which they would like a change in environment, or earn some money. Personally, I have worked as a packer at a florist's packing hampers during the Chinese New Year holidays. Although I was required to work overtime and was given minimal wages, I look back on those days with fondness now remembering my friendly co-workers and my pride in my first (albeit low) salary. I would highly encourage students to try out a variety of part-time jobs, so as to be able to try out different experiences, rather than opting for higher-paying, but boring, job.
