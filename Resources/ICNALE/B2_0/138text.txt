Should smoking be banned from restaurants? What will be the benefit of this? Is smoking really the reason why people die every day from lung cancer? In my opinion, smoking should be banned from all restaurants for many reasons that I think almost everyone will agree with. Smoking is one of the problems people encounter on the streets, in their daily life, and especially in restaurants. Some restaurants these days have provided smoking areas for smokers. For me, this is a good thing since it does not bother or affect other people who are enjoying their time with their family and friends. Yet, in my opinion, smoking should be banned in restaurants even if they offer a smoking lounge because it affects the health of other people, especially second-hand smokers. Second-hand smokers may not be directly smoking but it affects them more than those who are. All of us have opinions about smoking, but it really depends on who you are asking about this issue. Hopefully, smokers around the world will realize that smoking has a bad effect in their lives. We can't really blame those who are addicted to smoking but I think they should be reminded.
