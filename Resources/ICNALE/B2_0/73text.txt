Smoking is an activity, which will cause you to die because it increases the probability of suffering from cancer and many other diseases. However, there are still many citizens in Hong Kong that smoke. The government has done many things to get the public to stop smoking. One method that the government has done recently is to completely ban smoking at all restaurants. The supporters of this policy are mainly the people that did not smoke. Research has shown that secondhand smoke is harmful for humans. Even if you are not a smoker, if someone smokes near you, it also decreases your life. It is expected that non-smokers would not to want to sit near a smoking person. Therefore, this policy has been a great help to prevent the above situation. Of course, the smokers disagreed with this policy because they think that they have the right to smoke anywhere they want. Moreover, there are parties against this policy such as the restaurant owners, who are afraid that it will affect their income if they stop people smoking. I agree with the government’s policy. We cannot let the health of most people be affected by a few people’s money and freedom. This policy will also decrease the amount of smokers. For the above reason, it is the right decision to set this policy.
