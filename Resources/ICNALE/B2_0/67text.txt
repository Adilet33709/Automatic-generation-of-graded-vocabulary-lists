I support that the smoking ban should be set for all restaurants because it harms people’s health, depletes money, and has many negative consequences. Smoking is definitely harmful to our health, whether smokers or non-smokers. As we know, a cigarette contains over 20 carcinogenic compounds, and the smoke that a smoker and non-smoker breathe in is the same. That means non-smokers in restaurants have equal chances of being killed by toxic smoke, which is unfair. Cigarette smoking is expensive. Many smokers pay more than $1000 a month for packages of cigarettes. Besides finances, the diseases that result from smoking increase the financial burden of health care units, as more and more money has to put into the budget for treatments such as chemotherapy. If the smoking ban is not proposed, the probability of people in contact with toxic gases will increase and a higher budget would be needed. Of course, smoke smells, and it not only pollutes the environment, but also reduces our appetites. The nasty smell often causes nausea and affects the appearance of food. Another point is that the smell of smoke also comes from smokers, which is disgusting. There are so many reasons to support the ban of smoking in restaurants. Public areas such as bus stops and shopping malls have already assigned a smoking ban, so why should it not also be done in restaurants.
