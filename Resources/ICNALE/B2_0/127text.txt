Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As we all know, smoking harms our body and leads to lung cancer, makes our teeth look dirty, and smells bad. More seriously, smoking is not only harmful to ourselves but also to the people who surround us. Second-hand smoke causes those innocent people harm without having a choice. It is kind of unfair since you are the one who enjoys smoking and the nearby people will also be victims. Some would even say that "you can leave to avoid the smoke, it's your choice." If you are having a superb dinner in a restaurant, with good company, great music, perfect wine, and with all your kids, it would make a lovely photo. However, if there is a guest who was smoking nearby, all you can smell is the stinky smoke and you lose your appetite. Your first thought is to leave immediately, but it's really a pity to leave all your gorgeous food there. And since you are not the one who does wrong, it's not your fault. The smokers are the ones who should be blamed! Therefore, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
