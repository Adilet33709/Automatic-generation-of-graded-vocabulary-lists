Almost starting from the age of comprehension we have been repeatedly told about the negative impacts of smoking by various sources: our parents, our teachers, legislators, health campaigners, surveyors, and researchers. (The irony is that none of them are likely to have ever been smokers.) Despite facing numerous legislative restrictions and taxation in marketing and publicity, the act of smoking in public places (although to be fair, they cannot smoke inside buildings) continues to plague non-smokers. Why is smoking so popular, and in so many countries? Could it be that non-smokers have been lied to? Joking aside, I feel that smoking should be banned from restaurants. Smoking, or inhaling various gaseous substances, has been thought to be beneficial for our health and has been a part of humanity's history since the stone age. Religious groups such as the Rastafarians smoke marijuana to enter a trance-like state, which they believe brings them closer to God. In the 1840s, the Chinese addiction to that British exported led to the loss of many lives during the Opium Wars. Withdrawal from the addictive substance nicotine found in tobacco often leads to withdrawal, in which the person may suffer from fever, shivers, and diarrhoea. While smokers are also human and it would be unfair to them to have to smoke in special cubicles or walk 100 meters away from the restaurant just for a smoke, their actions encroach on the comfort of others around them and also affects their health. Perhaps a compromise, such as using a nicotine patch while in the restaurant would be beneficial to both parties without imposing on the rights of either. Nobody (I doubt even smokers) would like to have the smell of cigarette smoke lingering in the food they are about to consume.
