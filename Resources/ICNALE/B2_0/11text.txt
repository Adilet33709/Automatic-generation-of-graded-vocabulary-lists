I can't agree with the idea. I think that study is more important for college students than having a part-time job. Of course, if college students could do both equally, it would be best. Yet most of them, at least those around me, can't do so. This is especially true for students from national colleges who are given a lot of money by the country for going to college and studying. Therefore, I think they must study hard to become the people who are capable of doing something. Sometimes I hear the opinion saying things like the following: “College students should have a part-time job because it gives them many experiences to live socially”. I think doing various things is good for young people, too. At the same time, I think it is ridiculous to have part-time job that takes a lot of time when all of the rewards are just money. Seen in the long span, it is better  for college students to study hard about their specialties than spend their precious time on a part-time job. Studying is making their career. If they have to pay their college fees by themselves, they should have a part-time job but, if their parents or country do so, they should have a part-time job to live or to study not to play.
