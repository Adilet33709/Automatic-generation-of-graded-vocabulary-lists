My answer is "YES." Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. The first reason is that if someone smokes, some smell is produced from the cigarette, and the person's surroundings will smell bad. The bad smell certainly ruins the great meal and the mood. And the second reason is that smoking ruins people's health. Nowadays, more and more people die because of lung cancer. Some of them are addicted to smoking, but some of them are just breathing in too much second-hand smoke. Smoking not only makes people get cancer but also make the smokers' teeth become yellower day by day. That way, no matter how handsome he is or how pretty she is, when he or she smiles, their teeth will scare many people. The third reason is my personal opinion; I do not like to be with a guy who smokes in front of me. The bad smell really makes it difficult for me to breathe, and also makes all of my body, my hair, and my clothes smell bad! I think government should teach those who smoke to quit smoking, and the smokers should learn how bad their behavior is. So I completely agree that smoking should be banned at all of the restaurants.
