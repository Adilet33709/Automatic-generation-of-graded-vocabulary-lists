Getting a part-time job has more disadvantages than advantages for university students. For university students, the most important task is to gain academic knowledge and learn how to deal with real world situations. Therefore, one should consider whether a specific activity benefits university students according to these two criteria. Certainly, some will argue that a part-time job equips students with the experience to handle problems occurring in the society. However, a part-time job is not the most efficient way, and it dramatically shrinks the time students can devote to their academic studies. Most families in Hong Kong can afford to cover the tuition fees to finish university, so most students do not carry a heavy financial burden, and thus it is not necessary for students to earn money by getting a part-time. Nevertheless, students could choose to take part in an internship provided by the university in order to approach the world outside university. Compared with a part-time job, an internship could be better designed in terms of improving personal leadership, communication, and cooperative skills. Thus, university students are recommended to reduce their time involved in part-time jobs.
