When teenagers were high school students, they had less responsibility and less self-dependency and were still living in their comfort zones. Therefore, as soon as they enter college, they step into adulthood as well. As adults, they have to be independent, able to take care of themselves, and take greater responsibility for their lives. This is why college students must have part-time jobs. There are three reasons why they should have a part-time job: to learn not to be dependent on their parents, to be able to work, and to learn adult responsibilities. First, by taking a part-time job, high school students who have just entered college can be independent and learn to not lean on their parents anymore since they will part from them later on. Second, by taking part-time jobs, they can learn about working and earning money. Although part-time jobs are small, they can give them a picture of how the working world is and how they can make a living through it so that later, when they are working in a company or starting their own business, they already know how to adapt and what to do. Lastly, through part-time jobs, they can learn how to be responsible for themselves by doing their work properly, and to those involved in the part-time job, such as customers, managers, and co-workers. This is why college students must take part-time jobs.
