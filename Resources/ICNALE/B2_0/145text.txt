Part-time jobs are important to people who have insufficient means in their families. They are important especially for students because tuition fees at college continue to grow. Part-time jobs are a big help to students who are facing financial problems within their families. Students can afford to pay their tuition fees by earning money from their part-time jobs, which is also a way to help their families. Having a part-time job is hard, especially for organizing a student's schedule. According to television news in 2010, half of college graduates are working students, and every year this number increases, meaning that there are even more working students this year. Part-time jobs are also important because they help students gain knowledge and experience, which is a big help for future employment. Students may be faced with circumstances that they are able to handle because they have already experienced them; they can easily adapt to the job they are doing. On the other hand, students can also apply these skills to the course that they are taking and can apply what they learn from their course to their job. These are just some of the advantages of students having a part-time job. In doing this, hard work is needed and this hard work contributes to a better life. Education is very important to people; it is a basic requirement to have a good job in the future, which leads to a successful life.
