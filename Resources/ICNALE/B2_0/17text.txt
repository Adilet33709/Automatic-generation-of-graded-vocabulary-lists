I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country in terms of the health of the customers and the benefit of the restaurants. First, smoking has a bad effect on the customers both physically and mentally. Even if smoking and non-smoking areas are divided, smoke can invade into the non-smoking area. As a result, customers who are in the non-smoking area end up receiving the secondhand smoke. It is said that the secondhand smoking is more harmful for the health of a man than firsthand smoke. In addition, the bad smell of the smoke makes non-smoking customers feel uncomfortable. In other words, smoking in restaurants harms customers in both physical and mental ways. Second, smoking does harm to the restaurant. There are some people who are unwilling to go to the restaurants where smoking is allowed, whether completely or partially. In fact, when I choose a restaurant, I try not to go to restaurants that do not ban smoking completely. I know that some of my friends and family behave in the same way. As a result of this, in the case where a restaurant does not ban smoking completely, it gathers fewer customers than if it banned smoking. This is detrimental to the restaurant. In conclusion, in order to avoid these two bad effects of smoking which I discussed here, restaurants should ban smoking completely.
