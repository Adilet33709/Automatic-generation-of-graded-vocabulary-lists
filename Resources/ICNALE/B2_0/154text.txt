In my opinion. I think that it is not important for students to work part-time to earn extra money after school. The students do not have financial problems, so they should study thoroughly. When they have free time, they should read books or engage in other activities such as sports and music. However, if a part-time job does not interfere with the time to read books or perform other activities, students need to ease the cost of keeping a home. It is better to work part-time. We should examine their own abilities. We have sufficient ability to learn, coupled with a part-time job, without any study. However, a part-time job provides practical experience of working with others. Moreover, some students have financial problems with their families, so a part-time job is quite important for them because it will lighten the burden they place on their family and provide income for families to rely on themselves, so parents would not have to worry about their expenditure. Moreover, part-time work also provides self-training for work experience, responsibility for working, training in time management, and working with others as well. Therefore, whether part-time jobs are important depends on several factors.
