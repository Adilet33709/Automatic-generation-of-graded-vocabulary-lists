It depends on the person's needs. Different students have different needs. Rich students do not have to consider whether they have money to live or not, but for poor students, having a part-time job is very important. However, some students will have a part-time job in order to get work experience. For me, having a part-time job is quite important. My parents cannot send much money for me as an allowance, so if I want to buy some new stuff, go to restaurants or go traveling, etc., I have to pay for myself. Students have part-time jobs not only to earn some money as an allowance but also to get some experiences. Therefore, I always make myself have two part-time jobs during each semester. One, the key-in job, is for my daily life, and the other, a school office helper, is for the experience. Both of them are simple jobs and I can earn 95 NT dollars per hour. Although, having a part-time job is quite important for some students. Safety is also important. That is why my two part-time jobs are both provided by my school, NCCU. The importance of having part-time jobs is different for different students. As long as you need one, then just go find one. But we should also remember to not only take on the responsibility of the job but also protect ourselves.
