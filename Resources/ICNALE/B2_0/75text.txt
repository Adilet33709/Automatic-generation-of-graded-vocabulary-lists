Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. Many smokers would assert that smoking in restaurants is their private business, and as long as it is legal, they have the right to do it. Nevertheless, this seemingly strong argument is far from being valid because they intentionally omit the prerequisite of freedom: their actions cannot intrude into others’ freedom. Non-smokers, who also have the right to not inhale the stale cigarette smoke given out by smokers, may feel uncomfortable when the air around them is bad. Moreover, passive smoking may affect the health of other customers in restaurants because the cigarette smoke is proved to contain a high concentration of carcinogenic chemicals. For this reason, it is necessary to ban smoking in restaurants. In addition, if smoking is allowed in restaurants, some chefs and waiters may smoke in their working environment. In some cases, the smoking residue may fall into the food to be delivered to customers. Contaminated food is not at all hygienic, so when people eat it, they may easily get sick. Thus, for the health of the public and for issues of hygiene, smoking should be banned at all restaurants.
