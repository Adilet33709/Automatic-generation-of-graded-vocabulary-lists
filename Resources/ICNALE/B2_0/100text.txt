In my opinion, having a part-time job in college is not a priority whereas focusing on studies is. Unless absolutely necessary, for example if the student is on his own and has to earn money to meet his needs, I believe that having a part-time job is a great distraction from education and will slowly but surely take a toll on the student's health. First of all, having a part-time job takes away one's time for study and rest. What would a day in the life of a college student with a part-time job be like? I'm quite sure that it is similar to that of a varsity player. The student would go to school, eat, go to work, finish study requirements and before he knows it, the day is up. He'll go to school again with only a few hours of sleep and not be able to concentrate in the discussions. Even while working, he will not be able to perform well and even if he can perform, he would still be worried and stressed out about school and the workload given by his professors. By simply having a part-time job, he puts his education at risk, when in fact his education is what will get him a good job in the future. Although having a part-time job forces the student to be responsible, to learn time management, and to work quickly and efficiently given a short period of time, and at the same time enable the student to earn money, that path will be extremely tough. He will need a brain that is fully rested, not sleep deprived. He will have to sacrifice a number of things. He will be going through a lot already as a student, thus it would be physically, mentally, and emotionally better if college students do not have to prioritize having part-time jobs just yet.
