I agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country. The harmful side effects of smoking not only affect the smokers, but secondhand smokers as well. Secondhand smokers are the people who inhale the smoke that the smokers exhale from their bodies. It is not only harmful, but even more harmful than the smoke inhaled by a smoker from a cigarette. In a restaurant where there are many patrons enjoying meals, many of them will be non-smokers who dislike the smell of cigarettes. It is unpleasant to inhale smoke that both damages the body and is the result of another person's careless behavior. It is polite for the smokers to leave the restaurant and smoke at a designated place, because it shows consideration and basic courtesy. I firmly believe that non-smokers have the rights to stay within premises that are free from cigarette smoke. While smokers have the right to choose to smoke, it should not be at the expense of innocent non-smokers who have chosen not to smoke. By allowing smoking within restaurants, non-smokers are at the mercy of the poisonous second-hand smoke. By exercising this right, customers can have their meals in an environment that does not harm them in any way. Just like how hygiene is of utmost importance during food preparation due to health concerns, smoking can be comparable to the effects of food poisoning, if not more severe. To conclude, the long-term side effects of smoking would harm people and outweigh any costs of implementing a no-smoking policy countrywide. In order to effectively implement the no-smoking policy, all restaurants should participate and strictly enforce the policy. This would positively contribute to the efforts in reducing nicotine addiction worldwide.
