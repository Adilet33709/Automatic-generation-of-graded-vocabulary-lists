Hong Kong’s Government has introduced a law banning smoking in all restaurants. People have different opponents about that. However, in my opinion, smoking should definitely be prohibited in all restaurants in Hong Kong. There are many reasons that can support my argument. Firstly, smoking has long been defined as an unhealthy habit. Cigarette smoke contains thousands of different chemical compounds, which are mostly toxic ingredients. One common toxic ingredient is nicotine, which causes smokers to become addicted to the cigarettes. Once people intake nicotine, they will find it very hard to stop smoking. Cigarettes also contain ammonia, which scientists have discovered will let you absorb more nicotine. Another ingredient in cigarettes is tar, which is a chemical that causes cancer. According to research, smokers are ten times more likely to get lung cancer than are non-smokers, and they are three times more likely to have a stroke. Allowing smoking in restaurants can cause health problems to both the smokers and the passive smokers. From the viewpoint of business, tourism is one of the most important economic factors in Hong Kong. If smoking is prohibited in all restaurants, non-smoking tourists will be more likely to spend more time and money enjoying the clean environment in the restaurants. To conclude, banning smoking in all restaurants can cause less people to suffer from health problems and enhance the economy in the restaurants in Hong Kong. Therefore, smoking should be prohibited in all restaurants in Hong Kong.
