In my opinion, I (a non-smoker) agree that smoking should definitely be banned in all restaurants, as it not only has harmful effects on the non-smokers present but also may cause allergic coughing in many people. In addition, many youngsters are fascinated by the act of smoking and try to imitate it, which may later develop into a habit. Cigarette smoke is more hazardous to passive smokers nearby who inhale the active smoker’s smoke because second-hand smoke is unfiltered, causing more adverse effects. Several pulmonary diseases such as cough, bronchitis, asthma, and carcinoma of the lungs may occur as a consequence of smoking. Even if cigarette bans restrict freedom, especially for smokers, this step will go a long way to inculcating a healthier lifestyle. Many smokers who have gradually become aware of the ill effects of smoking are turning to de-addiction centers to break their habit. Even advocates of smoking in public areas disapprove of the practice when their offspring are exposed to it. Witnessing their elders’ smoking kindles a similar desire in youngsters, thereby giving birth to a new generation of smokers. To avoid these evils of smoking and ensure a healthy way of life for youth, it is not only our duty but also a necessity of life today to condemn such practices, if not legally then at least socially.
