Just like the old saying, “one coin has two sides,” a part-time job can bring us some convenience and money, and expand our social experience, but it can also waste our time, scatter our concentration, and may eventually influence our grades in university. For me, I think the bad effects of a part-time job outweigh the advantages, and it's not necessary for college students to have a part-time job. A part-time job wastes our academic and free time. University is a place to study the latest knowledge and to try to get involved in many fields, such as those outside of our own majors. However, a part-time job would take up most of our time, and if we cannot use our time in university more efficiently, we would lose the opportunity to improve ourselves both physically and emotionally. There are some other ways to make money and fulfill our social experience, apart from part-time jobs. For the students who are in great need of money to get through their university, a part-time job isn't the only method. They can ask for some funding and scholarship from their school, or apply to be a TA. Thus, we can find some academic ways to make money. Besides, an internship is a better way to get social experience. Further, a part-time job would scatter our focus from campus life. For example, if we get a part-time job as a tutor for high school students, we must prepare for the classes and travel to the classrooms or the students' houses. All of these things will bother us and disrupt our peaceful campus life. To sum up, a part-time job isn't important and necessary for college students. What we do in university will determine the path of our whole life, and obviously we should make better use of this period.
