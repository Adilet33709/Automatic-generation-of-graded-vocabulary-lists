Although some people think that university students should concentrate on their studies and they should not get a part-time job, I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are many advantages for university students to get a part-time job. First, if they get a part-time job which is related to their major, they will understand more about their major and future job. Many high school students in Taiwan just choose their major based on their grades or according to their parents. Some people find that they dislike their job after they start working in the field. However, they already spent years completing their Bachelor's degree and it may be too late for them to study another major in the university. One of my friend's major is accounting. After she had an internship at Ernst and Young, she realized that she does not want to work for the Big Four for the rest of her life. Another advantage of having a part-time job is earning money and the local economy. There are many traditional opportunities for university students to be a private tutor. Students can earn money while children in Taiwan can have a better education. According to some surveys, teenagers are more likely to spend money than other people. As a result, if university students cannot have a part-time job, there will be a negative impact on the local economy. In conclusion, university students have the right to have part-time jobs. Since there are so many advantages for students in getting part-time job, I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
