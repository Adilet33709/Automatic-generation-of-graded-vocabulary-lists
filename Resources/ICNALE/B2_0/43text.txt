University students are becoming increasingly better at finding ways to enrich their campus life. Apart from joining sports teams and student societies, having a part-time job is certainly among the top choices. The importance of a part-time job is recognized by a great number of people, including me. Most students go to university to prepare themselves to blend into the society in the future. Being successful in the society calls for skills of working and cooperating, which can be developed by working at part-time jobs. For instance, one can learn how to set the working agenda and get help from colleagues. Without these skills, even if the student gets a good occupation upon his graduation, they will possibly feel it difficult to get used to the job, and thus their performance will be unsatisfactory. Another advantage of having a part-time job is that it offers some money, which the student can use to make their life more colorful. Such advantage is embodied by the experience of my friend Bill. He likes traveling very much but he lacked the money to do it often. He overcame that limitation by finding a part-time job. With his salary, he has managed to travel to many places including Singapore and Tokyo. Of course, the salary could also be used to purchase a piano or football according to the student’s interest. In conclusion, having a part-time job brings a large number of benefits. Though it might be a bit difficult to find a satisfactory job, the outcome of part-time jobs is worth all the effort.
