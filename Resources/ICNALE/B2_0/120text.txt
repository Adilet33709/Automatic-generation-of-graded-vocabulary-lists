I agree with this statement because I think they can learn many things which are important after graduating through a part-time job. They can learn what they are good at and how to speak to others. They can understand what they are good at or not. There are some types of part-time job, teaching, delivering, cooking, customer service and so on. Home teacher, for example, is a typical job for college students. Those who have no idea of his/her future may want to be a teacher be being a home teacher. Or, those who want to be a teacher may change his/her dream because he/she realizes him/herself not good at teaching. So it's a good chance for college students to know themselves. Next, it is important to speak politely when we speak to others such as our boss, strangers and so on. When they only spend their time in college, they only speak to friends and they have few chances to speak politely. So in order to learn how to speak to others, it is valuable for college student to have a part-time job. So as I said, they can learn what they can do and how important it is to be polite through a part-time job.
