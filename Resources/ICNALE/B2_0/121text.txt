I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. My answer might have been the opposite before I got two part-time jobs this summer. After working from 9 am to 7 pm in the place where I work now, I find several reasons why it is important for college students to work part-time. First, by working part-time we gain different kinds of work experiences before we graduate and work full-time. Full-time jobs mostly require professional knowledge and skills and they are more serious; thus, it is more difficult to change your job once you are in a full-time position. What part-timers are required to do is often less professional. When you are applying for a part-time job, there should be more choices so you gain different kinds of experiences from doing different kinds of jobs. This is precious because it might be a help to your future career; for example, you might learn some professional knowledge through the work, and through various kinds of work experiences, you might determine what you really want to do. Secondly, by earning money on our own, we are more likely to spend money in a more careful way. It is common for young people to spend money on unnecessary things, and part-time jobs are not usually high-paid jobs. Thus, by being paid based on our work hours, we realize how difficult it is to earn a living and thus build correct concepts of money. Still, there are some more benefits from working part-time, as it is a help to those students that face economic pressures. To sum up, I think as long as students are able to use their time well - that is, part-time jobs will not influence their studying - it would be beneficial to students to have a part-time job.
