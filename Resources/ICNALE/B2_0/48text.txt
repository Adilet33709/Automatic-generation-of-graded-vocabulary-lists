I agree with this idea, mainly because there are many people who don't like smoking. Especially at restaurants, people who don't smoke may think that they want to taste their dishes without being impacted by smoke. Moreover, nowadays the number of people who don't smoke is increasing in Japan. In other words, the number of people who don't want to take their seats near smokers in restaurants is growing. Therefore, restaurants that do not ban smoking may lose their customers who don't smoke. For example, if there are two restaurants, one in which smoking is completely banned to smoke and the other in which smoking is permitted, I will choose the one that completely bans smoking because I hate smoke in restaurants. People who love smoking should go to cigar bars, not to restaurants. Both restaurants and bars can continue to attract their customers. In addition, I think that making smoking and non-smoking areas costs restaurants a lot of money. They must prepare some equipment to divide the two areas and the clerks must spend their time to do so and to ask their customers which area they prefer. To ban smoking is good for both customers and restaurants.
