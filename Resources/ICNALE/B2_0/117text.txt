When World Environment Day was celebrated, it was announced that about 55% of the people inhale polluted air. This is an awful alarm for upcoming generations. In the early days, human life was more secure than it was now. People used to inhale fresh air and drink fresh water, so they were healthy. The world’s total population is approximately 6 billion, and approximately 60% of this population throughout the world smokes. Out of every 10 people, 7 smoke. In Pakistan, this percentage is rapidly and continuously increasing. There are several reasons why people start this hazardous habit. The main cause is the stress of living in our current society. Unemployment is another major factor in the increase in smoking. In many areas of the world, tobacco is grown as an economic mainstay of the country. Effective steps should be taken to eradicate it from the world. Tobacco smuggling from country to country should be stopped, and tobacco and its products should be heavily taxed to make cigarettes expensive. Tobacco growing should also be banned in our country, because smoking is harmful to the health and causes mouth and heart cancers.
