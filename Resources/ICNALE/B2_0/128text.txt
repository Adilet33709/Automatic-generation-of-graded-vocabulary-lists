Most college students get a part-time job during their school days. Needless to say, lots of students try to get a job in summer or winter vacation, all because they have to make a living for themselves. They say that college registration fees are expensive, and I agree. It's hard to imagine our parents paying all that money. That's why we need part time jobs, Although some do it because they do need money, I say part time jobs are good experience for all of us. But they can be bad if the students try to make part time jobs their ongoing jobs. Some don't go to school at all because of this approach. Anyway, even with all their hard effort trying to earn, the regular wage rules are not being kept. My friend was working in an internet cafe for 3000 won an hour. It's not fair. How can he make a living out of it? The hourly rate should be increased or people should observe the rules. I intend to get a part time job in the summer, but I don't want to work under these circumstances. But I need money, which means that I have no choice. I wish this could all somehow change for all of us.
