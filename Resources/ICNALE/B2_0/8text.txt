I feel that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. In fact, I feel that smoking should be banned completely. Smoking has been known to cause heart disease, stroke, asthma, and more. Cigarette smoke also contains a great number of harmful carcinogenic chemicals, and greatly increases an individual's risk of developing cancer, especially lung cancer, later in life. Smoking in pregnant women can lead to stillbirths, miscarriages, premature delivery, and low birth weight infants. In fact, a study in the United Kingdom showed smoking causes more deaths than drugs, alcohol, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), suicide, homicide, and car crashes combined. How can Singapore, who has such severe punishments (caning, hanging, etc.) for drugs, allow this even bigger mass murderer continue to get around scot-free? Not to mention, in the case of drugs, there are a number that have no long-lasting ill-effects. Usually, only drug users themselves suffer from adverse health effects from the drugs, but that is not so in the case of smoking. Smoking not only has long-term harmful effects on the user themselves, but also on the people around them. It can even be argued that more than the smoker, passive smokers suffer worse effects. Most cigarettes have filters that filter out most of the harmful carcinogenic chemicals, preventing the smoker from inhaling them in. Second-hand smokers, on the other hand, do not have the advantage of the filter, and breathe in all the secondhand smoke. Hence, according to Mill's Harm Principle, we should completely ban smoking.
