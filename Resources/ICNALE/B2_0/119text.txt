Whether it is important for university students to have a part-time job or not really depends on the student. If the living standard of a student’s family is not sufficient to cope with the basic needs, the student might need to find a part-time job to supplement the family income, as the university tuition fees in Hong Kong may still be unaffordable for some families, even with subsidies from the government. However, because the money is not the greatest concern for students from ordinary families, I would say that the students should reserve more time to enjoy their university life. They could make use of their free time to join more activities and make more friends to expand their social circle, while developing their interpersonal skills at the same time. They could try organizing different things such as an event or an orientation camp for other students to accumulate leadership experience, which would be useful for their growth. After all, most students will start work after their graduation, where there will be many chances for them to work, so they do not need to start working too early. Although some may argue that internship experience is important for their first job after graduating, I argue that employers look more closely at your interpersonal and communication skills than the so-called minor work experiences when you are finding your first job. Overall, university students should enjoy their life and accumulate more experiences before starting work.
