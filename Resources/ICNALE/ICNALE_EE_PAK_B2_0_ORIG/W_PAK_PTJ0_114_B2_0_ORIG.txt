Part time job is some thing we do besides our regular work or studies. in modren world most of people are independet and they do part time jobs in order to get more money to full fill their basic or some do it to study by their own money. education is very costly and all the people can not afford it . so students on schlorships studying abrod or poor people do part time jobs in order to get their fees. some people do it as fun or some experience. part time job includes teaching working in a bank or some organization. I my self have taught while I was studying just for my passion. our society has some boundaries because of which some feel shy in doing work. in westren culture how ever does whatever work is appreciated. people must be hard working and most enjoy an be sincue to whatevere they do either studies or work. I personally feel as a student one must do some work doing his studying period for experience for confidence for mangement and also for his expensies to reduce burden of his parents. they can do jobs in franchise organization or may teach. part jobs are very helpfull in todays world and especially in our country as we all know the crisis. we most not feel shyness in doing any work that is respectable but most do it with intrest.
