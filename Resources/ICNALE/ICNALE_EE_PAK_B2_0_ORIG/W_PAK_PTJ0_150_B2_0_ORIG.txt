God has sent us in this world with a great purpose. And our holy prophet (PBUH) was a also sent with this purpose which was teaching and learning. In the beginning is it was very easy to get knowledge but with the passage of time it has become very difficult to acquire it. Because of the expenses of the study. People are facing lot of problem because of their earning and it is very difficult for them to manage daily bread. But as we know this is age of science and technology. Everybody wants to get more and more education. But due to insufficient income of their parents and some other worse circumstances they have to do part time jobs to meet their expenses. That's why these many students are doing part time job during their studies. It is very difficult for them to manage two very tiresome task. They are compelled to do part time jobs but it is necessary for them. The adverse circumstances taught them lot of things about like during their studies. They become very mature at very early age. But it is very sad because they can't pay full attention towards their studies. Sometime some students do very hard jobs which made them very much fatigue. And after doing some hard job they can't do their studies properly. It is very sad because our government is not doing something in this regard. As the days are passing the expenditure of studies is going increase. The Govt. should give some cession to the students in studies or at last provide some suitable jobs which are not very hand or difficult. And it should not be like that who prove students just to get money. And they deliberately don't pay full attention to their studies or left it incomplete.
