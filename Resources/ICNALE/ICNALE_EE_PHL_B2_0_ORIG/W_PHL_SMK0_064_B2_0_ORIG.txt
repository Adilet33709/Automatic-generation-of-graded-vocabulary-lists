People during celebrations, simple gatherings, occasions or even just to satisfy a craving tend to eat at restaurants. Many people enjoy being in a restaurant, even a simple restaurant will do as long as they have the time and opportunity to dine out with special people. When in a public place, there are also things that one should do like respect to the management of the restaurant and its facilities and to other customers as well. However, some people tend to do things that offend other people without knowing it. for example, when some customers smoke inside a restaurant, many people are affected with the smoke that he exhales. He does not only affect the person within or near his occupied table, but all the people that is dining inside. Second-hand smoke, the smoke that the smoker exhales that other people inhales, is very dangerous because it contains carbon monoxide and other gaseous toxins that pose adverse effects in our body. Even when they smoke outside, it still affects other customers that try to enjoy and unwind with the food and ambience of the restaurant. Smoking does not only disturb the customers but also poses a threat to the smoker as well as it contains harmful gases that damage his system. Smoking in restaurants should be banned in the country to save the right to enjoy the food and ambience offered by the place and not the cancerous smoke exhaled by a selfish customer.
