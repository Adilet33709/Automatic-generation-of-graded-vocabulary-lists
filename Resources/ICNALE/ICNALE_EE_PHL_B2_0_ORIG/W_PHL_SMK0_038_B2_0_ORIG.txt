Should smoking be banned from restaurants? What will be benefited from this? Is smoking really the reason why people die everyday of lung cancer? In my opinion, smoking should be banned from all restaurants for many reasons that I think almost everyone will agree. Smoking is one of the problems people encounter on the streets, in their daily life especially on restaurants. Some restaurants these days have provided smoking areas for smokers. For me, this is a good thing since it wouldn't bother or affect other people who are enjoying their time with their family and friends. But in my opinion, smoking should be banned in restaurants even if they offer a smoking lounge because it affects the health of other people especially second-hand smokers. Second-hand smokers may not be really smoking but it affects them the most and not the one smoking. All of us have other opinions about smoking but it really depends on who you are asking about this issue since all of us have our own opinions about smoking. Hopefully, smokers around the world would realize how smoking has a bad effect in our life. We can't really blame those who are addicted to smoking but I think they should be reminded.
