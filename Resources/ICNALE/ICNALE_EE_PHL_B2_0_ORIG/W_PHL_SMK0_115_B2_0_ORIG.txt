Every year, the number of smokers is currently growing. According to Department of Health - Republic of the Philippines, there is currently an estimated 1. 3 billion smokers as of last year. This number of smokers includes male and female aging from 15 above. Smoking should be completely banned not just at all restaurants but also at the public places in the country. Most of the restaurants are air conditioned; they don't allow smokers inside their restaurants but still they damage the freshness of the air outside. Some restaurants allow them to smoke but only in the smoking area. Smoking is already a part of a smoker's life. Some of them smoke after eating and some smoke during a drinking session. Some say that it can make them feel better and can calm their body. They don't even think what smoking can do not only with their health but also with their life. They don't mind with the surroundings and the people that might be affected around them. As we all know, smoking is very dangerous to one's health. It can cause you to have a lung cancer. It affects not only your lungs but also the other internal organs of your body. It also affects the health of the second hand smokers and workers inside the restaurants. Smoking can risk your life. You can even die from it. As a very good advice, stop smoking early before it's too late. Try to avoid smoking gradually until you can control and stop using it.
