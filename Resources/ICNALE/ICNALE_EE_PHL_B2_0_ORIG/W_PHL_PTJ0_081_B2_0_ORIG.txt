In my opinion, having a part time job in college is not a priority. Focusing on studies instead is. Unless absolutely necessary, for example if the student is on his own having to earn money for his needs, I believe that having a part-time job is a great distraction from education and will slowly but surely take a toll on the student's health. First of all, having a part-time job takes away one's time for study and rest. How would a day in the life of a college student with a part-time job be like? I 'm quite sure it is similar to a varsity player's. The student would go to school, eat, go to work, finish requirements and before he knows it, the day's up. He'll go to school again with only a few hours of sleep and not be able to concentrate in the discussions. Even while working, he will not be able to perform well. Even if he can, he would still be worried and stressed out about school and the work load given by his proffessors. By simply having a part-time job, he puts his education at risk when in fact, his education is what will get him a good job in the future. Although having a part-time job forces the student to be responsible, to learn time management and to work quickly and efficiently given a short period of time and at the same time enables the student to earn money, that path will be extremely tough. He will need a brain fully-rested, not sleep-deprived. He will have to sacrifice a number of things. He will be going through a lot already even as a student. It would be physically, mentally and emotionally better if college students do not have prioritize having part-time jobs just yet.
