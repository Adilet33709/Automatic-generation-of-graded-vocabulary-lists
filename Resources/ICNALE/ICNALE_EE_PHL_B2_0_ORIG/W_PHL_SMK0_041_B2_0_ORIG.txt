In my opinion, smoking should be banned on all the restaurants in the Philippines. This is because restaurants are purposely invented to sustain the hunger customers are experiencing. It is invented mainly to serve foods and drinks not to provide such entertainment that may cause harm to other people. Moreover, it would be unfair to other customers if smoking on restaurants is tolerable. Others who go to restaurants to dine and those who serve the restaurant may endure diseases caused by inhalation of smoke produced by cigarettes. It is very dangerous to the health most especially to second-hand smokers. Second-hand smokers are those who do not directly inhale smoke and eventually digest it into their lungs. They are the ones who unintentionally inhale smokes produced by smokers. Restaurants should not only consider gaining profit but also consider the effects their services might cause to their customers. Their main goal should provide services that may produce good effects to their customers. Health is a lot more important than money. It should be considered first before anything else. It would be better if certain industries should construct areas which are only made to serve smokers. This is to prevent certain diseases such as cancer committed through the inhalation of smoke.
