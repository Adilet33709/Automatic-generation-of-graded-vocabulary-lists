Today, people live in a fast-paced society. People need to survive and cope with a new environment every now and then. One noted term that one must always remember is practicality. Even if one faces a new world and begin with a new chapter, one must always consider living by practicality. In Filipino communities, many families find it difficult to sustain their financial needs and can ill-afford send their children to college. But these students are very eager to continue their college studies, work, earn and aspire for a more comfortable life. These college students, to assist and finance their studies, work on part-time jobs. These part-time jobs are really offered to students by various business and companies, a few of these are: crew members in fast-food chains, assistant librarians or a cashier at a grocery store. Having a part-time job while studying is a real tedious task and involves a wise use of your time. Truly, working while studying and studying while working is a real sacrifice; one must sacrifice his/her free time and rest to work and study. But at the end of the day, it will always be beneficial – he/she will finish her degree course and now has the better opportunity to be employed. All their hard work will be compensated and they will be able to help others as well. Having been employed in an early age, is not a disadvantage, it also gives the edge to these working students for having a hands-on experience on these jobs. They were able to learn and understand the flow of the business or organization that they were involved in. They also gain an additional network for their social life and most importantly, they will have the money they need derived from their own hard work.
