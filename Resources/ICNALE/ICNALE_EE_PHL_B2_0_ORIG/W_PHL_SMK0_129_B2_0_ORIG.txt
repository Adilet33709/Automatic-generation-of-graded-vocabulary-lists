Science will tell us smoking is dangerous. The contents of cigarettes are such that it could cause permanent lung damage or worse, lung cancer. This is because a cigarette has dangerous chemicals that damage the lungs permanently. Some scientists even say that one of these chemicals is used in space rocket fuel. But, it poses even greater threats to other individuals near the proximity of the smoker. This is what we call third hand or third party smoking. Why is this more dangerous? It is because the smoke that comes out of the cigarette is more impure than that of what smokers inhale. That is why the risks it poses increases exponentially. This is the reason why I think smoking should be banned in all restaurants. And I have two reasons why the risk of endangering more individuals will increase if we let it happen. One, these are public places. These are places where a lot of individuals gather to, of course, eat. Even if we say that there are smoking areas, the mere proximity of the smoker could pose the third hand smoking effect. Second, people can just go to other private bathrooms and more secluded areas to smoke. It is only in these private spots that we could be sure that they are not harming other people in the process they want to live out their bad habits. The state has the imperative to ban this precisely because public health is concerned here. They have a moral obligation to the people because their quality of life deteriorates every second they sniff third hand smoke. Just because smokers have the right to smoke themselves to death, they should not include other individuals in this process.
