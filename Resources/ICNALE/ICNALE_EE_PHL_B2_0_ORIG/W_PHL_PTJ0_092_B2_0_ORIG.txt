All over the globe, even quality education has its price. It leaves us with the question, Do College students need part time jobs in order to cope up with the expenses they will incur? In my opinion, it is better for the child to focus more on his studies. It is the parental responsibility of the parents to provide enough funds for their children who are studying in universities. It is their job to ensure that the child will be able to have enough money to cover his total expenses. It is the responsibility then of the student to do well in school for him to repay his parents hard works. Instead of getting a part time job, it is better if the child will save up his excess allowance for him to be able to help his parents in small acts. A child studies for him to acquire enough skills and training before facing the real world with confidence and knowledge. If the child will have a part time job, the child's time will then be divided which gives him less time for focusing on his studies. If the child gives his undivided attention to his studies, he will be more able to acquire more expertise. It would be more beneficial for the child to render his time fully to his studies for him to gain enough preparation. Also through not having part time jobs, it will lessen the burden and stress that school has already given on the child. So personally, having a part time job does have its pro which gaining money and real life experience but it also gives way for the child to have lesser time for his studies and perhaps later lose focus on it.
