To Smoke, or Not To Smoke: That is the Question Desecrating one's own body is one's own business. However, when it comes to polluting the air that billions upon billions depend on, it becomes nothing less of a grave matter with which everyone is rightfully entitled to an opinion. While some may enjoy having their lungs turn to ash and their lifespan shortened by years, others are more concerned about health of their own and the world. Asking about whether or not smoking should be banned is just the same as asking the Pope if he's a Christian. Regarding my stand on whether or not smoking be banned from restaurants, I'll say it bluntly; why the heck not? Another thing about smoking is that it will turn off people who are trying to eat. Who wants to eat when smoke fumes are floating around your face? Why eat at a smokey restaurant, when you can eat at someplace better. The health risk of such a practice is also a con here. Why risk your health when you can live a healthier life and better dining experience in a smoke-free place? The children's health should also be considered here. Would you risk your son's or daughter's health just to smoke a cigarette? My stand is they should. Can't you wait to get outside and smoke? Can't you resist the urge to light a cigarette? Do you have no shame for the diners who just want a good meal or atmosphere? Let me just say that I don't have anything against smokers but learn to do it in the right time and right place. Nobody wants to inhale your smoke. Who wants to breathe the same air that came from your smokey lungs?
