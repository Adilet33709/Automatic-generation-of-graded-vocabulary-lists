Cigarette smoking remained to be one of the Filipinos favorite diversions. In our country, cigarettes even though warned by the government to be dangerous to your health remains to be a best seller product to all ages because they are accessible in most public places including small stalls in the sideways, men with mobile tray on the roads and even in the alleyway outside of a restaurants. I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants because it is detrimental to one's health. Numerous diseases and illnesses including asthma, cardio pulmonary obstructive disease (COPD) and lung cancer may be acquired through smoking. Smoking is not only dangerous to the smoker but also to the person sitting next to him. Second-hand smokers they say are more at risks to receive the negative effects of smoking. It may also cause addiction because of the substance nicotine. Smoking in restaurants implies that the smoker has no social etiquette because he/she doesn't consider that smoking may irritate other people and worse it may also endanger their health. Many actions were implemented by the government to lessen this habit including the recent declaration of President Benigno Aquino III, who is a known smoker, that smoking must be prohibited in all public places and there are penalties for non-abider. In order for the government to be successful, strict law enforcement must be followed by authorities and willing cooperation among the citizens is necessary. I believe that public smoking must be banned not only in the restaurants but in all public places.
