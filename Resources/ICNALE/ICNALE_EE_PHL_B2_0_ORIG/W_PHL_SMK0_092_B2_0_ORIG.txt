Personally, I am for the ban of cigarette smoking in all restaurants in the country. Smoking has various negative effects. Second hand smokers or those who inhale smoke through does who use cigarette, are the one who are more prone to the negative effects smoking bring. Cigarettes which are used by cigarette smokers have filters which make the smoke less bad than the ones second hand smokers inhale. Inhaling smoke or the smoking act itself can trigger certain diseases. The deadliest disease can possibly be the lung cancer. I have been in a museum where a part of it showcased the lungs in different stages of lung cancer. I saw how black the lungs where even if the cancer has been present for 3 to 6 months. At the end of the cycle of the cancer, I saw how a regular sized lung shrink to smaller than an orange in size. On the other side of the table, if the ban will be passed into a law, the companies who manufacture this cigarette will lose its profits and may latter be bankrupted. Banning the use of cigarettes which only focuses on the health of the citizen may be considered as inconsiderate for we do not take a look at the other side of the table which benefits with these cigarettes. To sum it all up, I am for the ban of smoking though I consider the side of the manufactures. It would be extremely beneficial if the ones under the ban will examine and closely weigh the pros and cons before possibly passing the ban for smoking.
