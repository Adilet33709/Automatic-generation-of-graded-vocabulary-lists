A part time job may or may not be important for college students. It may be essential to be employed as part timers for those who belong to a family who are unable pay the required tuition fee and other expenses. The job is important to enable them to continue their college education and to improve their life in the future. A part time job can provide the student with an experience that may enhance social and personal skills. Some job may also be related to the course being taken by the student, for example, a 2nd year tourism student who is working as a part time receptionist in a travel agency. A lot of learning opportunities outside the classroom may be learned by having a part time job. On the other side, for students who have parents and benefactors who can provide all the financial support needed to attain a degree, a part time job is not important because being a student is a full time job that needs 100% of one's attention, time, effort and dedication. Part time job may cause the student's attention to be divided from his/her studies. It will also alter the regular schedule because it will be necessary for working students to select a schedule that will fit perfectly with his/her working shift. The job may also yield lesser time spent for reviewing and studying. Sleeping and resting period that is important for the student's overall well-being, concentration and attentiveness may be greatly affected. Fatigue and additional stress can be expected by a working student. These disadvantages of having a part time job however may be overcome by the student's capabilities, values and attitudes so that working while studying may be possible.
