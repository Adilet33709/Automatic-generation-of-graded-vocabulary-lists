I strongly believe that students should have the urge to commit themselves on part-time jobs pertaining to those who are at the tertiary level. This is because on our century today, the tuition fees are inevitably increasing. Some parents would have a hard time paying the tuition fees of their children. To lessen the burden our parents are carrying, we must have the guts to help them. Another reason would be for students to gain experience and to develop their strengths and weaknesses. Engaging ourselves on things that we do not usually do can help improve our well-being. One's personality can be changed through socializing. Also, this can help in applying for full-time jobs in the near future. Brought by experience, one can be easily accepted on companies if they already had previous experiences most especially those types that enhance one's skills. Lastly, for some students who do not have anything to work with during their free hours, taking up a part-time job would be the best way to occupy their time with. Instead of engaging ourselves on unnecessary matters, we can help not only to our family and self but also to the own country as well. One can gain extra income for future necessities.
