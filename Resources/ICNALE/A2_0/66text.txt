I disagree with this opinion. I think part-time jobs are not necessary for college students. First, college students must study hard. It is very important for college students to study. I think that a student is a person who studies academically or is educated, not someone who works. If a student thinks that their study is finished when their classes are finished, they are wrong. Study is not limited. Second, I think that college students, whether or not they have a part-time job now, will graduate and be working about four years later. After all, college students will have to work in the future, so they should not work now. Third, working is very hard and takes up a lot of time. A man said that one hour for a college or university student is worth ten years to an old man. Actually, the period which is spent in college or university is very important. Students must spend this time seriously. Fourth, there are a lot of things for students to do apart from study. Club activities may benefit college students. Club activities teach a lot of things that are not taught in education. College student should spend a lot of time in these activities, not working. I think part-time jobs are not necessary for college students.
