I agree with it. I have three reasons to support my answer. Firstly, I think we should have a part-time job to learn how work before being employed in a company. We go to a university to learn many things before being employed and we have a lot of  time to do something after classes. We can choose whether we have a part-time job to learn how work or not. So we should have it. Secondly, I suppose we should know how hard earning is. I did not know that earning money to live is really hard until I had part-time job for which I could thank my parents. I think it is important for us to know how hard earning is and to thank our parents. Thirdly, we can use payments from  a part-time job to do many things for experience. As I said we have a lot of time in a university and we can do something for ourselves using payments from our part-time job. For example, we can go travel and see the world, buy books, organize a student conference and so on. I think that experiences will help us after we graduate. So I agree that is important for college students to have a part-time job. This is because we can learn how work, we can know how hard earning is and we can get good experiences thanks to a part-time job.
