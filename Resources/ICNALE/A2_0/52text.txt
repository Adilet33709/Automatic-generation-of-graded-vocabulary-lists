I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are four reasons to support my opinion. Firstly, many people go to the restaurant at lunch time and dinner time. Restaurants are the place where many kinds of people are. Smoke does their health harm. Many families with children go to the restaurant at dinner. Children are more strongly affected by tobacco smoke than adults, and research has revealed that people exposed to secondhand smoke are more harmed than smokers themselves. Secondly, if some people smoke while the other people are having meals, people who are not smokers can't taste their meals very much because of the smoke. Thirdly, students, such as junior high school students and senior high school students, often go to restaurants. If they see people smoke at the time, they could be affected by this become interested in smoking. In spite of being under 20, they could begin to smoke. Lastly, in these days, there are restaurants that people can enter with their pets, for example, dog cafés. Not only to humans but also to dogs, smoking may do harm. This is why I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
