I disagree with the view that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. My reasons are below. Completely banning smoking at all the restaurants does not fit with the world of reality because a lot of men smoke now. As such, it would be impossible to completely ban smoking at all the restaurants at the present. If smoking is banned in all the restaurants, many men may be against this ban. Many men who smoke think that it is not reasonable to ban smoking in all the restaurants. Further, those smokers will not go to the restaurants with the ban, which will bring trouble to the restaurants. They will have business problems. If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants, it is harmful for the interests of the restaurants. All the restaurants will give way to men's attitudes. Although smoking is not good for the health of the people, men don't want to give up smoking. They say that smoking helps them in many ways. Some say that they feel happier by smoking and forget troubles by smoking. All the restaurants will allow men to smoke, for all the restaurants want to get more financial gain. I think maybe we can do another thing to solve the smoking problem in restaurants but not completely ban smoking in the restaurants in the country right now.
