I agree with the statement: smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. And I don't agree with the statement that smoking is a personal habit. For example, smoking is the worst. Smoking damages not only a smoker’s body but also the bodies of people around the smoker. This effect is called “secondhand smoke”. Secondhand smoke is the smoke that moves from a smoker to other persons around the smoker. Allowing secondhand smoke to affect others is bad manners, especially in crowded common areas such as parks, stations, airports and streets, because this smoke causes health problems such as asthma and lung cancer in others. Lung cancer is the worst sickness. This sickness's mortality rate is high and a lot of Japanese people have been killed by it. Smoking has a strong relationship to lung cancer, and many scientists think that smoking causes lung cancer. So I think smoking should be completely banned in places where many people are.
