I agree that all restaurants should ban smoking. Actually, I believe they must ban smoking, but most people still don't care at all. Four out of ten Thai people smoke. It is a serious problem in Thailand. The smoking problem is getting worse and worse every year. Kids that are around thirteen years old start to smoke because members of their family smoke. The law is very weak. Nobody cares or obeys the law. I think Thailand should be more serious about this problem since the percentage of people dying from cancer has also increased. The law is just written on paper and announced to look good but in practice, no one follows the law. This is what happens in Thailand. We ask for many things, we wish to be on top in this area, but that can't be because we don't respect the rules. When we get arrested we just use money or refer to a famous family, so nothing happens. Why don't Thai people follow the law so we can become developed? People just do as they desire and not what society wants. When people separate and don't care about the law, it is harder to stop them and to develop the country. Please do something serious and start it ourselves. We can teach ourselves to be followers of the law and be models for others so all these problems can be solved. It is hard to ban smoking if people still don't care, even if I agree with the topic statement.
