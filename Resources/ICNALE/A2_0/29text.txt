Smoking in the restaurant? Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I think I agree. Smoking has to be banned in the all restaurants because smoking is harmful for all people. People are happy to eat food in a restaurant, but if one guy is smoking, I think many people are very unhappy. It is not very polite. I think it should be rule in the country. If we have a rule, we can let people know that smoking is wrong in restaurants. So I think it should be a rule in restaurants. I think it will reduce the very bad example for children. Public places are for everyone, but many people don't like the taste of smoke. Smoking is very bad especially for children and students. Smoking is a very bad example, so we can't learn this bad smoking habit. I also don't like to smoke because smoking makes our health bad. If you go to see a hospital, you should know to pay attention to our health every day. So people shouldn't smoke in public places, not only in restaurants. We should know this rule. It is to avoid harming other people.
