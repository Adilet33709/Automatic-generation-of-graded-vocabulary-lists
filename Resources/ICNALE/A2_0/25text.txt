Recently, the biggest issue for college students is tuition. Specifically, it is like a “tuition bomb.” We pay large amounts of money for tuition. Look around; there are many people who get loans. In my opinion, college students having a part-time job is not important. It is dependent on condition. If you are rich enough, you don't have to worry about paying for tuition. If you are not, you must be a part-time worker. You can't afford to pay for tuition, which means you are not rich, so you have to get a loan to attend college. Then you have a debt, and repay it yourself, because you are not child anymore and can't bother your parents to pay tuition. However, there is an exception, which is a scholarship. Theoretically, receiving a scholarship is easy. You can just study hard and participate in a party or festival that you belong to, but my experience, receiving a scholarship for four years is very difficult . So, I have had a part-time job since I was 20. Therefore, if you cannot study hard, and are not rich, you have no choice. You must find a part-time job. So, a part-time job is not important for everyone. It is only important to some.
