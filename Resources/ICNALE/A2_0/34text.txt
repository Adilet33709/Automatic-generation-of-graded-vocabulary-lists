I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Not only would it make the restaurants look nice, but it would also let everybody have a good meal time in the restaurant without and smoke. For example, I had a meal with my friends in a restaurant near our neighborhood. A lot of people spoke and yelled loudly and were even drinking too much. However, the most important thing was that some people who looked like evil men were smoking continuously. It smelled so disgusting that I felt a little dizzy. I was really unhappy, but I could do nothing to prevent it. All I could do was leave the restaurant. That's why I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. Many people are dating, chatting, and studying in the restaurants. I think that smokers are bad for letting other people breathe their second-hand smoke. In addition, according to research, it is easier for people who breathe second-hand smoke to get a disease than smokers. Without our health, we can't enjoy the good things in life. To sum up, no smoking at all the restaurants in the country is a good way, and I hope it can apply to every place.
