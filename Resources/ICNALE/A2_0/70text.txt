Is it important for college students to have a part-time job in our country? I agree that it is. Many college students need money for their school life. They want to do a lot, buy a lot of things, and eat a lot of food. However, they do not have enough money to do everything. So, they should earn money. However, they cannot have a full-time job because they are students and the most important thing is to study. So, if they want to work, they should get a part-time job. Of course, parents give money to their child, but it is not enough to keep up with their life. Sometimes, when students work, the business owner does not give them money on the day it's due. So many students cannot get money even though they work hard for it. So, the country should make a law concerning this problem, and the owner should follow this rule when they hire students part-time. In conclusion, a law should be made and the students should work hard to earn money for their life.
