I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job, because college students have to learn how to make money and spend money. People who do not work are unable to realize the significance of money and randomly spend money. Certainly, because some university students the Gary economic agent cannot but work earn the living expenses are also one of the reasons. But work may not surpass own elevating capacity, in order to avoid the schoolwork they could not bear, instead the gain does not equal the loss, like this lost the significance which worked. Although more than half of present university students go to work, not many can give their studies proper attention. While work may enable students to experience society earlier and lighten some of the burden on the parents, if people take work too seriously and they are unable to give enough attention to their studies, they may not be able to graduate, which will increase the expenses of their studies. It is therefore important that the student's work does not conflict with their study time.
