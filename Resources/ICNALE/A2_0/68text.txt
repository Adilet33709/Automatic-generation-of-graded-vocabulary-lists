Smoking in restaurants should be banned. I agree with this statement  as much as possible because restaurants serve food and drink and are for anyone want to eat good food, with good atmosphere and an environment conducive to eating. Smoking is one of the drugs that harms the human body. Most restaurant customers will not sit smoking in their restaurants. It makes people dissatisfied and they may not return to receive service any more. A restaurant is a restaurant, and serves food and drink, but not to smoking customers. Some restaurants will have room for smoking customers to sit. Some restaurants will mark a smoking area. Most customers will take children, old men sit to eat, some families have a pregnant wife eating as well, and the idea of smoking itself is disturbing others. Because tobacco smoke has a nasty bite on the eyes and is smelly, people around you and everyone within the restaurant are hurt. The conclusion is that smoking is hazardous to health and people around, such that the body's state quickly declines, so I think we should care for each other well and exercise frequently together rather than mess with drugs. All people should be concerned with the dangers of smoking, and we should seriously ban this in order to save the next generations.
