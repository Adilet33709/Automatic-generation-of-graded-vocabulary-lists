Nowadays, it is generally accepted that smoking is becoming more and more of a problem in our country. This phenomenon brings great damage, especially when it relates to smoking in restaurants. Some think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants; others don’t think so. I prefer the former one because I have some reasons below. There are many reasons accounting for my opinion. On the one hand, smoking in restaurants will damage smokers’ health and also other people's health. Most people know that smoking is harmful and can lead to many terrible diseases. It is not fair for non-smokers to get diseases because they sit together with smokers in restaurants. So we must insist on the ban. On the other hand, smoking will damage the environment. People want to eat in a clean restaurant. The unclean environment of the restaurant will make people unhappy and have a bad effect on them. People will not like the restaurants if there are many smokers inside. Clearly, if we are blind to this problem, it is very likely that restaurants will receive more and more complaints about smoking. We must pay attention to this problem.
