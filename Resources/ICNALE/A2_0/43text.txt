I agree, because I am not a smoker, and I am a girl. Smoking is a waste of time, I think. May I take you on a little journey into my mind about smoking. Let's imagine that we are smokers! We buy cigarettes every day to burn into ash, but actually what we burn is our money; that is terrible that we buy something that can hurt ourselves with, especially our health. In other cases, cigarettes are poison. Everybody knows that, but they cannot leave the cigarette because the poison is in the cigarette itself. If someone smokes it once, he will try again, and again, and again. He was poisoned with the cigarette, and in the period, the cigarette was the primary tool. If we ask ten men, eight from them will say “I am a smoker.” This is the proof that cigarettes are poisoning almost all men in the world. If we don't smoke, we are passive smokers, we must warn smokers to change their smoking habits. If they can't stop smoking, we should tell them to be understanding of us as passive smokers so that they only smoke in private areas not in public areas, such as restaurants.
