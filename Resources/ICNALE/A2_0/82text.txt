In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. I have some reasons to support my idea. Smoking is an unhealthy habit because cigarettes contain burnt soil and something that can cause cancer. It also destroys people’s bodies. Smokers usually have some diseases. People having smoked for a long time are killing themselves day by day. What is more, it is obvious that the people who eat with them breathe in the same polluted air, which leads to people losing interest in what they are tasting. Further, the second-hand smoke is harmful to their health too. If the law of banning gets through, the atmosphere of restaurants will be more perfect, and the good smell of delicious food plus nothing else will fill the whole room. The more fresh air they breathe and the less smoke they inhale, the longer life they will have. The cleaning of public places should not only be applied to the restaurant. The dining room should be completely devoid of smoke too. If all the restaurants are clean, I believe more people will benefit from this. So all in all, the government should do something to ban smoking in all the restaurants in the country now.
