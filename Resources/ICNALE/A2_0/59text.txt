Companies in Indonesia sometimes have no smoking areas, because in Indonesia there is not yet an international standard. Industries which have an international standard usually have an area for smoking; smoking in Indonesia was forbidden a long time ago, but this is ignored because almost people in Indonesia are hard smokers, so it is not easy to stop people smoking. Almost all young people smoke every day, in fact every hour. Almost all of them use the cigarette as a friend when they are quiet, in restaurants, sometimes in public facilities, at bus stops, and at the market, etc. In restaurants, almost all people smoke when they are waiting for someone. All of the country should be banned from smoking, but most people ignore it, even though they know the effects of smoking. Restaurants in Indonesia have no area for smokers, so people smoke everywhere. There are many cases of death from the serious effects of smoking, but many people ignore it. Safety signs in restaurants forbidding people to smoke are ignored by some people and they still smoke without obeying the rule. Activities in the restaurant, which are followed by smoking, make people consider it a place for smoking. So, smoking should be banned in every city and country.
