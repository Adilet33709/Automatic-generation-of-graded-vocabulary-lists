We should completely ban smoking in the restaurants because smoking can hurt all people's health. Some people really don't like the smell of smoke, or even hate the smell of smoke. The restaurant is a place to eat, and I think no one likes to smell smoke when they are eating. Sometimes in the restaurant, there are children and babies with their mothers, the smoke is not good for them and can affect their health. The restaurant is a closed room, so the smoke can fill the restaurant. So if you have to smoke, you should go out of the restaurant, to lower the effect. According to figures, the number of people who has died from second-hand smoke is more than smokers, so smokers are just like killers, but they do not know that they are killing people. Although some restaurants have set smoking places, you can still smell the smoke even when seated outside of the smoking place, which can still affect people's health. I think if you really want to smoke, you can try another thing instead such as candy, or something you can put in your mouth that doesn't hurt yourself and other people. I think this is the best way to solve the problem if you want to smoke in a restaurant.
