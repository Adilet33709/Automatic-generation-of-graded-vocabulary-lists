Generally speaking, I don't agree with the idea of topic B, which is that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Now, I like to discuss the reasons for my opinion. To begin with, smoking in the restaurant is a right. Restaurants are public places for all customers, so no one is qualified to limit who can go to them. What's more, people should observe the law, and not just do anything that they want to do. In the next place, we can reserve a smoking room for those people who are already addicted to smoking. In this way, we protect the smokers' personal rights. Additionally, when smokers eat in the restaurants, they will not disturb the other customers. Then, the quantity of cigarettes sold will decrease, thereby affecting the economy of the society immediately. On the other hand, which is the last point, this ban will not only incite smokers' negative moods, but also lead to the development of a social trend. Some smokers think that smoking can help them solve difficult problems and relax their thought. In the end, to draw a conclusion from above, I strongly believe that smoking shouldn't be banned at all the restaurants in the country. We can take some other ways to solve the problem of smoking in restaurants.
