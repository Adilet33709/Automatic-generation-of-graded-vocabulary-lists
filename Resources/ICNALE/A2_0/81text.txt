I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. According to hospital statistics, smoking is bad for children, the elderly, and adults. Smoking can harm our health, especially our lungs. If you smoke a lot, you can cough a lot. On the other hand, buying cigarettes is very expensive, as it includes a health tax. If you quit smoking, you can save a lot of money. On television, the ads to ban smoking are popular. Most celebrities on TV tell everybody the dangers of smoking. As for me, I hate people who are addicted to smoking, and I also hate the smell of smoke. Because my sister is a nurse, I learned a lot from her. She has taught me about the dangers of smoking. Smoking is very risky and harmful. I don't think anyone should smoke in public, especially in restaurants. That behavior should be banned strictly. People should respect others. In public, we should speak quietly and not smoke. I think the government should make a strict rule for restaurants to follow. If people smoke at a restaurant, they should get a fine. For everyone's health, banning smoking in public is very important. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
