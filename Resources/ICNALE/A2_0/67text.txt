I think the important thing about working only part-time is students will have their work during free time. The only time to be used is there. They cannot take all of it to dedicate to work because most of the time it will be mainly studying. Today, part-time work enables students to lose great learning because students are divided into less time to learn to work. Sometimes they claim they are tired from working so they do not want to learn. There is no time to study if they work, but working part-time is not considered damaging. It is useful time as well. The practice itself is the experience itself. Part-time work is used in everyday life and is considered beneficial in helping alleviate their burden because their parents do not have to interfere with their money. When students have a personal problem or need for money, they do not have to ask their parents, and working part time is considered to allow us to recognize the value of money in that the money came hard. It will not come easy to exchange many things and sacrifice their own personal time in exchange for money. Also, we know that parents have money from hard work. Therefore, we have learned that we should help parents save their money and think about our obligation to send money. Let us learn as much as their love gave us. Finally, work is considered part-time by students, but is helpful to souls who share the correct time and select the appropriate work for their studies will not affect their courses and does not affect our health, and will not cause trouble if it can be a good thing in the lives of students.
