I agree that smoking should be banned in public restaurants. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. This is a good idea, even though it takes away some of our freedom. As we know, smoking is harmful not only to our health but also to the environment. Smoking can lead to many diseases, such as lung cancer, and smoking affects non-smokers more than it does smokers. The ratio of passive smokers getting ill is higher than that of smokers. So many nonsmokers are against smoking. Therefore, a government ban on smoking is very necessary and important to us. It is a measure to protect our health and the environment, so many people, especially nonsmokers, agree with policy. Some people say that it takes away some of our freedom, but I think this is a one-sided view. If one wants to smoke, he may smoke in private, not in a public restaurant. In fact, smokers still have the freedom to smoke. But I think smokers had better give up smoking, not only in private places, but also in public restaurants and everywhere. It will be beneficial to all of us. Smokers and nonsmokers thoughts are different, but they must communicate to achieve the goal of no smoking in public restaurants, to protect our health and the environment.
