I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Nowadays, a large number of college students have a part-time job. Some of them hold that part-time jobs can help them to adapt to the society well and give them many experiences. Take a friend of mine, for example: when Lily was a college student, she worked in the supermarket as a promoter or worked as a private tutor every weekend. Then owing to her experiences, she quickly acquired a good job after graduating from university. In terms of other students' opinions, they think that they can buy the desired goods that their parents cannot afford. I know a student who works part-time in a restaurant as a waiter so that he can earn enough money to buy a computer. Thus, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. However, our parents don’t always agree with us about getting part-time jobs. They are afraid for our studies and our safety. In my opinion, having a good part-time job is beneficial for students. We should pay attention to the advantages of part-time jobs and make the most of them. Meanwhile, we should learn to gain knowledge from our part-time jobs and use them as helpful tools for our development.
