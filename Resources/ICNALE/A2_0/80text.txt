Smoking is a bad habit which is always done by stupid people, who think they look cool if they are smoking, or they believe that smoking can reduce their stress. But they forget about the risks to their health, and they do not care about the people around them. People who do not smoke (passive smoker) but spend their life in a smoking area will be in danger because they breathe in the bad air or the pollution from the smoker, and it will be cause problems for their lungs. Restaurants are places where people eat or gather, so there are people and food. So, I agree that smoking should be banned in restaurants because the air will be bad and full of pollution from the cigarettes. And the passive smoker will get harmed. And the food will also become toxic because it is infected by the air. So, if we eat the food, it will make our body sick because the quality of the food is not good anymore. Also, the smoker will make people around them become passive smokers, and they will make their family sick. Smokers do not understand that when they are smoking, it is the same as if they are burning their money, and smoking will decrease their time in the world. One cigarette equates to one hour. So can you imagine? Nothing benefits our body from smoking; it is full of toxins that can destroy our body. I think it is better to avoid cigarettes and save our health, our children, and our families. Live happily without decreasing your time in this world because of cigarettes.
