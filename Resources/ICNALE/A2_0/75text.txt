Recently, there has been a discussion about whether it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are two opinions in answer to this question. Some people think that it is good to have a part-time job, while others don't think that it is good to have one. I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job for several reasons. Some people might agree with this assertion. Firstly, if they have a part-time job, they can relieve their parents' financial burden. Besides, it can also increase their chances to practice their knowledge in society. However, some people object to this opinion. They claim that part-time jobs will waste the students' time and affect their studying. Therefore, students should just focus on studying hard. As far as I am concerned, students should have a part-time job on the basis of working selectively. For one thing, by working they can keep themselves well-informed of as much knowledge as possible. For another, by being selective, they can avoid working at jobs that everyone can do, and thus avoid wasting their time and learning less. Not being selective will make working ineffective because they won't be doing the job that they should be doing. All in all, it is necessary that we should have a part-time job and be selective about the kind of job that we take.
