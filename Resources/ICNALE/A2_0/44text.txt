Studying is more important than other things for all people in the world because with study especially in school, we can get a lot of knowledge, friends, and experiences. For example, in Indonesia, compulsory study is nine years. But in reality, poor people cannot continue their studies because they don't have enough money. That is one factor that requires students to have a part-time job, especially university students. They must have a part-time job. Why do I say it like that? First, because not all students at university have parents who can afford to pay for them. Second, if we have a part-time job, we can learn how to manage our time. Third, if we have a part-time job, we can help our parents pay for our studies at university. We can live by ourselves, and we do not always have to live with other people, especially our parents. The conclusion for the importance of college students to have a part-time job is that, if we have a part-time job, we can help our parents pay for our studies at university, we can manage our time, and we can study without living with our parents forever.
