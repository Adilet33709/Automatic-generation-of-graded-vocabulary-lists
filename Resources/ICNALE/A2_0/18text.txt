As we know, college students are doing their task in college to study; almost all of them come from outside the city. Perhaps they are not from a rich family but from a poor family. Some of their parents have professions such as a farmer, teacher, or fisherman. In fact, it is not their obligation to look for money, but this is a kind of demand for their life. They need money for their life. So, there is a reason why some people need to have a part-time job and others do not. Sometimes, we find that college students have a part-time job to complete their necessities such as living costs and college administration. And we also found some college students do it to search for an experience for their future and have a better life, and some only want to fill in their free time or have fun. So, in my opinion, having a part-time job is important for college students. Besides helping their parents, they can learn how to manage their time and their finances in their life from now on.
