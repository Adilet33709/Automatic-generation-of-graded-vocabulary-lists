I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have three reasons. First, if students have a part-time job, they can learn how they work in society. They will have to work when they graduate from college, so I think they should have time to prepare for working in society. Second, if they work in various situations, they will learn how to communicate with people. College students should experience various situations. Third, college students need a lot of money when they graduate from college, so they must earn some money to use then. I think it is too late for them to earn money when they become employees. Because most college students are adults, they should earn their own money. However, the main thing that they should do is study. College students should have enough time to study. It is useless for them to have no time for study because of working too hard. College students don't have to earn too much money, so I think they should work during summer vacation, winter vacation, etc. If they experience working, it will enrich their life.
