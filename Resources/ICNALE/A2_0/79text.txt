I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. First, college students will look for a nice job after graduation, and they know that when owners need to pick new staff, they usually want people who have experience in another office. Students can gain experience by visiting other countries, working somewhere, and doing an internship. My friend worked for a long time at one company when she was a college student, and then she could get a job there. Second, students always feel that college fees are very expensive. So, they need a lot of money for college life, but they cannot work for a long time or every day because they are students and students have to study. Finally, they can learn the value of money. Today, we live with a richness of everything. If we want something or want to change our telephone or watch, we can get it from parents or somebody else. So, we don't know the value of money. I think that if college students have a part-time job, they will grow into great people and will change their lives, so a part-time job for college students is very important.
