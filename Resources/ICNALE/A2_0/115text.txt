I agree with this idea I think college students should have some part-time jobs. I also think they should study hard while they are students. They must live well between part-time jobs and study. This is not because college students need much money. If they have a part-time job, they will have many friends and meet many different ways of thinking. I think there are two types of part-time job. The first one is a job in a juku (cram school). If you have a part-time job in a juku, you must have your own students. You have to study, too. Your previous study is useful. The second type of part-time job is a job in a store. If you work as a shop clerk, you must communicate with a lot of customers. Your communication ability will improve. You will have a lot of responsibility. It is hard to continue a part-time job, but responsibility is needed in society. You will have to have responsibility for everything you do when you become an adult. If you have a part-time job, your perspective will be broad. Before you start life in society, you should practice communicating with many other people and learn how to survive in society.
