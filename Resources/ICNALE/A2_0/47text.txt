Smoking is one of the drugs that has resulted in physical harm to people who smoke and don't quit. It also has resulted in people around people who smoke and being a narcotic type will be not charming in the club. The people around you are society too, and smoking in a restaurant, a place people eat much, is bad. Both children and adults eat together, so someone smoking in a restaurant may make people who are eating not like it or be unsatisfied and they will see that smokers are not good. Another restaurant where people do not smoke will make the restaurant look like it is good quality and more people will go to eat more food together. Restaurants that make a pure atmosphere may be the favorite for the common person. Therefore, stores where the atmosphere is pure to clients and diets are right and do not smell or have odor caused by cigarette smoking should have "no smoking" on their menu or in the restaurant itself. For people dining to know that this store is a non-smoking place will cause people to prefer to eat food at your restaurant and menu and better tastes may be made the more you sell.
