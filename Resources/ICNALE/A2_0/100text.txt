I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have two ways to instruct it. First, for personal health, I've heard a phrase "Health is Wealth", which means that people who have a healthy body and keep themselves well perhaps have a lot of money in their personal life! Smoking can encourage the body to become sick. When someone is smoking, it can harm his or her body a lot! Especially cancer. For example, when someone is smoking, that smoke will go through their mouth and throat and arrive at the heart. Day after day, the body can't restore its health; it's a big question in life! Second, for friends, neighborhood, classmates, or strangers around us, second-hand smoking is terrible, because it has a bad composition; it is worse than it is for a smoker. Most people don't like to make themselves do something they don't like. So for the reasons of personal health and second-hand smoking, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. But I know this ban may make smokers unhappy, because this ban stops smokers from smoking everywhere. I think they will still have a smoking habit in their life, but this ban is based on fairness for everybody, so when a smoker wants to smoke at a restaurant, they must think of other people's wishes.
