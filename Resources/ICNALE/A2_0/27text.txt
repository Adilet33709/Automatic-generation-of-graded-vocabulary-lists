Some people hold that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. However, I don't agree with this opinion. I have some reasons to support and explain my opinion. For one thing, everyone has his or her own hobby. No one likes others to change his or her hobby. If somebody likes to smoke, we have no right to prevent them from having dinners at restaurants for this reason. For another thing, restaurants are public places, and while smoking at public places is not good, we can do nothing but advise smokers. However, the restaurants' owners can set up a room for smokers. When they want to smoke, they should go to that room to smoke. This can separate smokers from most customers, and I believe more and more customers will be interested in the restaurants that reserve a room for smokers. With this method in restaurants, both smokers and other customers will be happy. Thus, it is difficult to completely ban smoking in all the restaurants in the country because we can do other things to solve this problem. However, as we all know, smoking is an immediate threat to health; it can cause serious cancer. As such, we all had better smoke less.
