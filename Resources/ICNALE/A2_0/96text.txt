I do not agree with the restaurants that allow smoking in their areas because it is very dangerous and harmful for both people who are smoking and the people around them, especially teenagers who may take up the habit and adolescents who are curious and would try to stop. Most teenagers do not like smoking in restaurants with children and the aged, so a check is made very inappropriate because it is highly toxic to other people. Teenagers like to smoke a lot, in canteens too. Especially male students like to smoke everywhere, in canteens, in front of schools, food shops or in restaurants. They think they are cool and very handsome and girls will fall for them but this is not the case. A girl who likes a boy who smokes will be sorry in the future because she is putting her life in danger and risking getting cancer with that boy. She doesn't smoke but she smells it every time so someday she may get hurt from smoking before him because there is no protection from smoke. If the restaurants agree to not allow people to smoke, they can save many people's lives because people are saved from danger. We should ban smoking everywhere, not only in restaurants. The police should catch them, too.
