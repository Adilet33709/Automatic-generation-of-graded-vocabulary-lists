When we hear the word smoking, what idea do we have in our mind? All doctors in the world say that smoking is not good for active smokers and it is even worse for passive smokers. Some of us wonder how that can be. The answer is that when the cigarette burns and the active smokers begin to smoke, they breathe clouds of smoke from their noses and mouths. The clouds are inhaled by passive smokers, but the clouds come from the lungs of active smokers and the passive smokers do not know about the active smokers' health. Nowadays, the government has built smoking areas in public places, for example, at department stores, airports, and hotels. The government did so because they hope that the active smokers will not disturb the passive smokers, the health of babies, and the woman who are pregnant. To be honest, the government would be confused if they forbade cigarettes because almost all the employees in this country work at cigarette companies. If they close or stop all the activities of the cigarette companies, they have to think carefully about its effects. The truth is that cigarettes are not good for active smokers and their environment, especially people around them. We hope that the active smokers can reduce or maybe even stop their hobby of smoking. Our health is very expensive, so we have to keep our health.
