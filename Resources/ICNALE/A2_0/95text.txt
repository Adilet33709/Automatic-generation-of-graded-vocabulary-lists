I agree with part-time work because of the beneficial use of leisure time. I can have the money to spend on things other than studying. There are many places to work, such as restaurants, convenience stores, shopping malls, and dress stores. Going to work after school is better than going to a party with friends. Having parties with friends, we spend too much money. I cannot save money unless I go to work. We can have money to save. Our fathers and mothers will be happy if we can get money by ourselves. When I spend money that I have from work, I feel happy because it is my money. The money that my father and mother give to me I save and use to pay for studying. Work also helps me to be strong and adult. I know what to decide when I have problems at work. I know how to talk to bosses, friends, and buyers. I try to make everyone happy. When I am at home, I do reports and homework. I will read books because I know I do not have too much time to read books but I try to do my best. It is very good to work when I am a university student. I can feel like I am growing up.
