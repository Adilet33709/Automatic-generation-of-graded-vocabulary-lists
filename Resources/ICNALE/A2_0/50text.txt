Nowadays, college students want to have a part-time job during their study periods. In my opinion, I think everything has two aspects much like how one coin has two sides. On the one hand, if you want to gain more experiences in society, to have a part-time job is a good thing; on the other hand, if you pay more attention to your part-time job to the extent that you lack enough time for your study lessons, then having a part-time job is not a good thing. For a college student, studying is most important. Most college students believe that a part-time job can offer them more job opportunities in the future, and that it can also improve their confidence and sense of responsibility. In this way, to find a part-time job is a practical idea. However, there are other college students who believe that college is a place of study. They consider that if we spend too much time on working at a part-time job, we may delay our school work. In this respect, concentrating our attention on studying is more important than having a part-time job in society. Recently, college has become more and more market-focused, and a college student must be provided with a variety of skills. To have a part-time job or not, it all depends on your personal abilities.
