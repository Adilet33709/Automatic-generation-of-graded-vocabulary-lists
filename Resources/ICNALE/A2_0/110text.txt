I believe that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. While we are growing up, we can look after ourselves. It was our mothers who took us into this beautiful world. They taught us how to walk, to speak and so on. Now, it is our turn to care for our parents. Thus, earning enough money by working for our boss at a part-time job may be a good choice. In addition, we enrich our experience, which can only be acquired from a real work environment. On the other hand, we shouldn't focus too much of our attention on it because we are just students right now, not workers. If we don’t have enough fundamental knowledge, then we can't do well in our part-time jobs. Do not forget that our studies can help our work while our work can help our studies. To obtain much knowledge is the main mission of college students. How to balance studying and working is the main challenge for freshmen. Thus, planning is most important. Having a part-time job during summer or winter vacation is a great idea. We are also adults, so we can make our own schedules. A part-time job is an important part of our college student life!
