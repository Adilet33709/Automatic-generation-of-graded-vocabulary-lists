I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Many people smoke in our country. Smoking is really bad for people. I know the smokers cannot stop smoking. It is bad news for them. However, when they smoke at restaurants in the country, non-smoker also breathe smoke through the air. Although a place may be separated into parts, one for smokers and another for non-smokers, the smoke flows through the air. It affects non-smokers, so the law should be made for non-smokers. It is also helpful to smokers. When they want to smoke, if smoking was banned at all the restaurants in the country, they would go outside. This is uncomfortable, and if they work, it makes them really busy. They could not make time to smoke. As time goes by, maybe they would stop smoking. Smoking is really bad for our bodies. If the people want to live healthy lives, they should stop smoking. It should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country and all over the world.
