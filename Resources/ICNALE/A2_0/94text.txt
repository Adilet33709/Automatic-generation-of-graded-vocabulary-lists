I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the world. As someone who hates smoking, smoking should be banned in all public places as well as in the restaurants in the world. Today, a lot of countries have banned smoking in public places, but still a lot of countries haven't banned smoking in public places. I will state reasons why we should ban smoking in restaurants and public places. I have three reasons. First, smoking damages other people. Smoking is a personal freedom, but smoking in restaurants interferes with the freedom of others. Second, smoking is bad for children's education and health. A lot of different people come to restaurants. There are men, women, and children. When a child comes to the restaurant, if the guest sitting next to the child smokes, it is bad for the child's health and education. Finally, other guests receive unpleasant feelings from smoking, especially in restaurants. They eat delicious food, but smell bad smoke. They do not like the smell. Also, they want to get the natural taste of the food. If mixed together with smoke, they can't get the natural taste of the food. For these reasons, I think smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the world.
