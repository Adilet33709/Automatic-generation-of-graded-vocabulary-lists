There has recently been a heated discussion about banning smoking in restaurants. I agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country. I used to ask some people why they would want to smoke. They answered that there are many reasons for it. The first guy said that his work and family gave him much stress, and smoking seemed to be the only way for him to release the pressure. Moreover, smoking has been like his best friend, one to whom he could tell everything that he wanted to say. The second guy also had the same reasons as the first guy. In addition, he thought that if he could smoke a good cigarette, he would look like a rich man. So I thought smoking was a way to show one's riches. Through the analysis, I think smoking in all restaurants is nothing but harmful. There are three reasons to support my ideas. First, smoking is usually bad for our health, and if he or she is smoking in the restaurant, the smoke will spread out all over the restaurant, and other people will also be affected by the smoke. Second, as using a good cigarette to show off one's riches is not a good social trend, we should ban this bad social trend together and encourage people not to smoke in restaurants anymore. Third, a restaurant is a place where some people can eat food or chat with others. As such, if you are smoking in the restaurant, you may affect other people’s ability to eat food happily. To sum up, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
