I disagree with this opinion. Smoking should not be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. First, a restaurant is a place in which people not only eat food but also relax. In my experience, I have relaxed at restaurant by talking with my friends and sleeping. Some people relax by smoking. If smoking is banned at all restaurants, they cannot relax at restaurants. Business at restaurants will decrease. Second, smoking does not always cause trouble. Actually, some people don't like others smoking. But establishing separate smoking areas will solve the problem. It enables those who want to smoke to smoke and those who don’t want to smoke to avoid others smoking. Third, I think there is no merit to banning smoking at all restaurants in Japan. All problems about smoking, except about health, are sufficiently addressed by establishing separate smoking areas, and what need is there to do more? Nothing is needed. But more needs to be done in establishing separate smoking areas. We have to be more careful to divide smoking areas, not to ban smoking. What can be done at restaurant is limited. I agree that smoking should be banned in other public areas in Japan, but not in restaurants. Smoking is not only the problem in restaurants.
