I think during the period of university we should try to work part-time, but achievements are very important. So, we should do appropriate part-time jobs. The jobs should be based on our academic studies. When you find part-time work, it will affect your studies. Students should concentrate on their studies. After all, students' work is to study and graduate. Part-time work is very important, but it is not more important than studying. If it will not affect my academic performance, I think I will try to do a part-time job. It is good for students to have part-time jobs because this helps cultivate independence among young people. After-school work enhances a young person's social development. After-school work also teaches students how hard it is to earn money and helps develop thriftiness in the younger generation. Because they earn money, students can pay for their education and thus they will value their education even more. And, in return, their experience will make them understand better what they have learned in classes and books. Part-time work allows us to learn many things. But students should not spend too much time on part-time work. I believe that when we graduate from university, part-time work clearly pays a very small salary. But we learned some life experience before graduating. Part-time work is obviously good for some people. These experiences are important.
