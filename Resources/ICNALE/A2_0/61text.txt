College students have to study hard in school. Should students do part-time work? I think so because I think you can learn many things from working, and we can know how to get along other people. We also learn more skills in the community. It is a way to learn other things and we can know how to live in the world. We can also know how hard our parents worked for us. If you have a part-time job, you can learn how to perform duties and learn many things. We can lighten our parents' burden. Parents should feel happy we can do it for them. I think there are two types of part-time jobs. One is fixed work. The other is unfixed work. The unfixed work involves going everywhere to work. If you think have to work every day, you should find fixed part-time work, because if you are only a student, it might be difficult to find all the jobs because you have to study in school. So, I think finding a part-time is good for us. Do you agree?
