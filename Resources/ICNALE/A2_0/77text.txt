Smoking is harmful to health; therefore, many countries forbid smoking in public places. Although when they are smoking, smokers are very comfortable, the second-hand smoke that reaches others is harmful, because the smoke contains carcinogenic chemical substances, which raises the probability of getting cancer to higher than that of the smoker. Therefore, in public places, these smokers are being unfair. If the smoker wants to smoke, they should select a place with good air circulation, so it will not hinder others. They will also enjoy smoking well and will not need to accept others' advice again. If restaurants establish a smoking area, this benefits the smoker and isolates the smoker from other people, so they cannot smell the tobacco from a distance; this is good for everybody. Actually smoking is not good to the body, and such law may cause the smoker to stop smoking; this is actually advantageous and is harmless for the body.
