I agree with the statement. There are three reasons why I agree. First, people who smoke everyday often suffer from poor health. For example, they might feel tired all the time and even develop cancer. If this happens to you, you can't live with happiness. It is a very serious problem. To live healthy is the most important thing. Second, people around smokers feel bad, and they also suffer bad effects. The smell of cigarette smoke is bad for non-smokers. They can't fully enjoy eating dinner. In addition, second-hand smoke is more dangerous for non-smokers than first-hand smoke is for smokers. It is a more serious problem than the first or second problems. Finally, some smokers’ manners are bad. For example, after smoking, some people throw their butts on the ground. It is also a serious problem for other people. Some people might say that people in developing countries get money from making cigarettes. This is true. If we ban smoking, their jobs will not be needed. However, a job making someone’s health bad is the worst job. Smoking is dangerous, and is completely bad. It is better to buy things other than cigarettes. It is good for you, and other people. This is why I agree with the statement.
