I agree that is important for college students to have a part-time job. First, as a freshman in society, I wanted to find a job recently. When I mail my resume or my work experience to employer, I never receive an answer. I try to find an explanation; it's maybe because I have less work experience than other people. Second, a part-time job can train students' personal time management; a lot of college students are used to being like superman, which means college students use half of 24 hours to sleep, play computer games, do night active, and so on. But they can't spend time resting, studying, or doing something good! Third, part-time jobs can earn more cash. College students have more and more opportunities to join a lot of parties or buy something we like; we need money to do this. More and more families can't offer much more money to their children now, so perhaps they think how to solve this question, and part-time jobs may be useful!! So I think part-time jobs can train college students to have more work experiences or be independent. So I agree it is important for college students have a part-time job.
