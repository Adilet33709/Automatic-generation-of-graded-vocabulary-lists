I do not agree with smokers being able to smoke in any place, not only in restaurants. Smokers should take a break to smoke where others are not happy with it. Smoking may be suitable for some parties, but not in restaurants because they are places for taking pleasure in food. I wouldn't like there to be any smoking in the building but do not have any objections to people smoking outside. I do think that people should be made more aware of the damaging effects of smoking. I find it unpleasant when people are smoking just outside the exits of buildings as you are forced to breathe in the smoke. Many people can't breathe because it stings and is hard to take a deep breath into the body. Thus, in my point of view, it is a good idea to say that smoking should not be allowed in the restaurants, universities, workplace, and many places where many people are. Smoking should happen outside only at lunchtime, not at regular breaks, and smoking should be banned at all workplaces and public places. I hope to see this happen at my university too. I don't want to see students smoking, either.
