I agree that students should get a part-time job. I think a part-time job has positive and negative effects. The advantage is that you can learn more about how to socialize with other people; this can help you to find jobs when you graduate. The disadvantage is that you may need more time to study, or your grades will be so bad that you could flunk out of school. A part-time job can have both positive and negative effects on a person. First of all, students will be able to earn more money in order to pay their tuition, their rent, or buy whatever their heart desires. Moreover, one can learn how to socialize with others, which is beneficial when looking for a job upon graduation. However, the time needed for one to study diminishes. This can cause one's grades to drop drastically, which may, in turn, cause one to fail. In conclusion, students should only get a part-time job if they are able to handle their studies as well. Students who have a part-time job enter the society earlier than those who haven't. While working part-time, students experience how the society functions and learn how to deal with issues maturely. Having a part-time job could give the students hands-on experience to test their skills and see whether they are interested in the field of work. Additionally, students working at an early age encounter the hardship of earning a living themselves; therefore, they treasure and view money differently. Students with a job could also help out their family's finances.
