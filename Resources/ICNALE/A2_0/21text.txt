I agree. I think smoking should be absolutely prohibited in restaurants because it will affect the health of the non-smokers there. This is unfair. Although smoking is not illegal, it is really a bad deed to force others to breathe in second-hand smoke. Therefore, I think smoking in restaurants should surely be banned. Moreover, the number of customers will decrease because some people are afraid of second-hand smoke in the restaurants and will avoid going there. This makes the restaurants suffer a financial loss. Three years ago, I had my dinner in a restaurant. While I was eating, I smelt a kind of disgusting odor. At that moment, I discovered someone smoking, so I forwarded my complaint to the staff of the restaurant. But the staff said that the smokers had the right to smoke there since there had not been any law to restrain them. I was extremely angry. Luckily there are laws to restrain smokers nowadays. This is good news for the non-smokers. It allows Taiwan to have fresh air that will no longer be polluted by smokers. Smoking is actually so annoying that the laws against it should have been set up even earlier.
