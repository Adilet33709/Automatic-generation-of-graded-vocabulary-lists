I absolutely agree with the point that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. A restaurant is a place for people to have a nice dinner with their family. Smoking will destroy the warm atmosphere and also do harm to people's health. Someone may say that smoking depends on personal preferences, but it is a selfish behavior. It will make other people unhealthy. The important thing is that smoking can shorten one's life. It's very terrible. Personally, I do not like the people who smoke in public places. As is known to all, smoking just increases the risk of cancer in people. Moreover, second-hand smokers are more influenced by the smoke than smokers are. Especially in public places, smoking is extremely harmful. The smoke from cigarettes is poisonous gas. If there is no one smoking in a restaurant, people will enjoy themselves more and more. The law may make smokers give up smoking so it would also be beneficial for them. A professor called Peter in a Hong Kong university said, “One cigarette can kill at least 50 mice.” Smoking just makes people feel bored with no benefits. In conclusion, smoking should be banned in all restaurants and people should do this by themselves. We have an obligation to make sure that people have healthier lives.
