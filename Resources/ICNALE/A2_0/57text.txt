We know that smoking should be banned in all places actually. Why? Because it has many risks for all of aspects of our life, even in the restaurants in this country. And I think it is done properly. I agree with this statement to ban smoking in restaurants. Restaurants are public facilities where there are so many people who are not smokers. Many people take their children because restaurants are places for people to get together. So directly or indirectly, smoking can influence the comfort of visitors. We know there are so many bad effects of smoking. First, the biggest effect is disturbing the breathing and the lungs, and causing lung cancer. This is one reason why smoking is not allowed in restaurants. But I think, this rule is not only for restaurants, but also other public facilities, such as the market, mosque, church, bus stop, and railway station. One solution is that the owners of restaurants provide a special place for smokers. But sometimes, this rule is not followed by some people, they are lazy about going to the smoking area. So, next time, the government has to give a rule about smoking, they should give a hard punishment for everyone who disobeys the rule.
