I agree with this statement without thinking. I dislike smoking for the reasons that it smells bad and is dirty. Smoking is very bad for the smoker's health and is troublesome to other people. Restaurants are mainly places for eating, so smoking around people who are eating is very bad for the atmosphere, as well as the smell and taste of the food. It is important for the dish to taste good, have a good smell, and for the atmosphere to be good. Tobacco has a bad smell which is harmful for humans and a smoke which is a white and grey gas. There are many children in restaurants. Tobacco smoke is very bad for children. Moreover, tobacco smoke soaks through children’s clothes. If someone smokes in a restaurant, we cannot wear new clothes. We must be aware of this. Smokers should stop smoking in restaurants as early as they can, and they will be healthy in the future. If they die early because of smoking, their family will be very sad. They will regret that he didn’t stop smoking. Therefore, people who smoke tobacco should stop smoking in the restaurant, and I think that smoking in a restaurant should be a crime.
