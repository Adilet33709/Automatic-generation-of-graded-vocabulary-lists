These days smokers have no consideration for others in restaurants. Smokers don't care about other people in restaurants. It appears that smoking is harmful to other people. Therefore, I really agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, because not only is smoking very harmful to smokers' health, but it is more harmful to non-smokers who breathe secondhand smoke. Smoking can lead to various cancers and other diseases. Because of the number of people of all ages in a restaurant, a smoker causes much damage to children, older people, and pregnant women, as well as other people. Passive smoking is more harmful to our health than smoking. Therefore, passive smoking increases the risk of various cancers and other diseases. This makes non-smokers exposed to tobacco smoke very angry. Besides, the smell of smoking is terrible, so the taste of food is lost. Restaurants should make smoking rooms. People who smoke cigarettes mustn't smoke in a restaurant. If they want to smoke, they fill the restaurant with smoke and put many people's health at risk. Also, restaurants need restrictions on smokers. Smokers need more consideration for others in restaurants and they must realize that their smoking is harmful to other people's health.
