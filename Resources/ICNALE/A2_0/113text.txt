A part-time job for college students? If you talk about a part-time job, we will find agreements and disagreements. How about you? Is this important to you? Firstly, everybody has different opinions. I think a part-time job for college students is very important at this moment because the students could make money to buy all the tools they need to live by themselves. College students could buy their books, food, drinks, and enjoy their time with special friends. Secondly, I feel that a part-time job would help their parents. If the students' families do not have enough money for the college student (child), who will be completing the need for the college students? Of course, the college students themselves. College students should value the great struggle of living by themselves. Thirdly, in my opinion, a part-time job is good for college students because they have a lot of free time, so college students should use their time to make sure everything happens ok. Fourthly, I feel a part-time job gives experience to college students because the experience is the best teacher of additional knowledge for college students. For the reasons above, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Actually, we must realize that a part-time job is good for college students.
