I don't like smoking, so I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have two reasons. First, it is true that smoking causes serious damage not only to smokers but also to people near smokers. People who smoke get lung cancer more frequently than people who don't smoke. Second, I think the most serious problem is that smoking at a restaurant makes people who don't smoke feel very uncomfortable. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are the times that all people enjoy eating and relaxing, and a restaurant is the place where people enjoy eating and relaxing. At the same time, however, a restaurant is not a private place but a public place. Perhaps some people relax when they smoke, but I think that smoking in a restaurant is bad manners. For the enjoyment of all the people, everyone should stop smoking. Therefore, all the restaurants should make a rule that bans smoking. If people want to smoke, they should go outside and enjoy smoking. These days smoking is banned in more places day by day. I think it is good, encouraging all of the people to make a comfortable environment and promoting good health.
