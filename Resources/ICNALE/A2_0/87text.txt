Yes, I do agree, if students need to do part time work after school. Right now the economy in Thailand isn't good at all, and many people get laid off from their jobs and it is also hard to find a job even if you're a bachelor's degree student. A job at McDonald's or some restaurants doesn't make a lot of money but at least you can get experiences, which are more valuable than money. If you compare a student who has been working and has experience to another student who hasn't been working nor has any experience, I think the one who worked will have more opportunities. It's also helpful to his or her family. Using their time wisely and not wasting time by getting a job is much better. Many students get a better life from doing part time work after school. We should not wait for help from others. We must help ourselves first, and then we will be strong and ready to fight any difficult thing after graduating from university. Parents won't worry about us and they will watch over our steps to becoming successful in the future on our own. I want to see Thai students survive by themselves not just wait for their parents help.
