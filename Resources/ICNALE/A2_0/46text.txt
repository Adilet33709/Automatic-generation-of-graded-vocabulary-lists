Nowadays, many teenagers want to smoke. They think smoking makes them feel good and look good. Somehow, they think that it makes them feel more relaxed but they don't know about the bad results of smoking. It increases their chance of lung diseases and heart failure. Watching the video in class this evening opened my eyes a little bit more because tobacco contains about 4,000 chemicals, including 200 known poisons. Every time someone smokes, poisons such as benzene, formaldehyde, and carbon monoxide are released into the air. Those are among the most important. In fact, some of my friends like to smoke, though most don't. Non-smokers will probably tend to hang around more with non-smokers than with smokers, while smokers usually don't care. Smokers need lots of money because smoking is expensive and keeps getting more expensive. Not only does smoking create bad results for smokers but also the bad results affect nearby persons and they get vexed. The last reason is that there are many consequences to smoking like bad health, addiction, cessation, and economic costs. Second hand smoke is a major problem, since smoking is allowed in a lot of public places. Second hand smoke has fifty cancer causing chemicals. Thus, I agree with banning smoking in all areas.
