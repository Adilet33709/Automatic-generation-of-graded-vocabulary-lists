I don't think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I don't like smoking but I think smokers want to smoke when they go to the restaurant to eat or drink something. If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, smokers will have little place to smoke. Then, smokers can't smoke anywhere. I think it’s better to have some place in restaurants in which smokers can smoke. However, I dislike cigarette smoke and there are small children and babies in restaurants, so I want to completely separate the seats of smokers from the seats of nonsmokers. Recently, companies or department stores, for example, have smoking rooms. Smokers can smoke only in the room. I think this is a very good trend. Smokers can smoke in the room and nonsmokers are protected from smoke. Smoking is very bad not only for smokers’ health but also for nonsmokers’ health. Nowadays, there is also a cigarette tax. The number of places where smokers can smoke is getting smaller and smaller. Therefore, I hope that the number of smokers will gradually decrease. Now, a price of cigarettes is a little higher than before. Some smokers will begin to give up smoking to save money.
