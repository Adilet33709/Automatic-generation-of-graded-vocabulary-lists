I agree with the statement. There are three reasons why I agree. First, college students need a lot of money. They must pay college fees. They also need to buy clothes, and to eat and drink in order to be sociable. They should not force their parents to pay a lot for them. They should pay the costs by themselves, so they should have a part-time job. Second, they can make friends when they work. By working together, they will become friendly. It is very good to have many friends. For example, when a student has a problem, he or she can ask their work friends for advice. Their advice might be different from college friends’ advice. It is important to hear many kinds of advice. Finally, a student is able to practice for their future job by having a part-time job. If they have not had a part-time job, they don't know what kind of job is good for them. To have a part-time job is a good chance to what kind of job is good for a student’s future. Some people might say that students can study more if they don't have a part-time job. This is true, but I think it is more important to have a part-time job. Having a part-time job will make a student a better person. This is why I agree with the statement.
