I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. In college, most students have part-time jobs in order to pay for something, such as food and transportation. On the other hand, foreign books are very expensive. It costs about NT 1,000. So far, I have a part-time job. I think I have learned a lot from my part-time job. For instance, I have improved my communication skills and become more self-confident. In 2009, every country faced an economic recession, and many people lost their jobs. Maybe many families faced that difficult problem. To deal with the problem, students had to get a part-time job. The situation is very common in a global economic recession. If students get a part-time job, it can decrease parents' struggles. Everyone knows a high education is very expensive. Having a part-time job reduces the burden on parents and increases t students' experiences. Finally, I agree with having a part-time job in college. It is not only to earn money but also to learn a lot. We can make a lot of friends in different fields. Getting a part-time job has a lot advantages if you can manage your time. If you are good at time management, having a part-time job is a good choice in college.
