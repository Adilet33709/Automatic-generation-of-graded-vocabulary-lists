In my opinion, part time work is a job in which an employee does not work full hours, or is not a permanent job. It is stated like that because we don't have to do it, unlike serious stuff like studying. I think having a job is important but I will suggest to someone that wants to work a part time job not to overdo it, though working is necessary to gain experience before graduating from university. Many students work part time jobs to supply themselves with additional funds. Working part time is ideal for students, since it allows them to balance their academic needs with their school needs. Often, a school will provide a list of available part time jobs for the benefit of students, and many college towns deliberately tailor their openings for students. Students don't have a lot of hope for the future, except that it won't get worse. I support that if we want to help our families and have extra money we have to do a part time job. For example, if parents pay 5000 baht per month, and we have to pay 2500 baht for the dormitory, we have only 2500 baht to spend. We have to eat and pay for many things. We shouldn't ask parents for more. We should find a job to reduce the money we get from parents. They will be too tired to work because they are old.
