There are many smokers in the world so non-smokers are damaged by them. They even smoke in public buildings. I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country for three reasons. First, we can help poor children. Many countries have increased cigarette taxes and also increased prices so there are many people who cannot buy them. We can help by stopping buying cigarettes. In Korea, the cigarette price is 2,700 won. With this money, we can give water, rice, bread and new life to poor children. That is, spending money on more valuable things can help someone. Second, secondhand smoking is a big health hazard. Smokers already know that, however they do not care about others' health, even in their own family. For example, about 600,000 people are killed by secondhand smoking every year. Especially, fetuses are more damaged and harmed directly by smokers. As a result, secondhand smoking can kill people. Lastly, there are many smoking areas in the country. Because the government could not completely ban smokers from smoking, they made many smoking areas. Therefore, smokers keep this policy because it is at the least some concession to non-smokers. In summary, we can help poor children by stopping smoking, smokers can damage non-smokers' health, and there are many smoking areas available, so I think that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants.
