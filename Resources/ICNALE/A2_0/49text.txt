A college student is transitioning to adulthood. A college student is different to junior high school or senior high school students. At junior or senior high school, we didn't think about our future. At college, we have opened our minds to plan for the future. We can do so with a part-time job. A part-time job is very important for college students. I feel that college students who do part-time jobs can become more confident, independent, and responsible. College students who interact and deal with adults learn, through experience, how to behave appropriately in public. Moreover, working for a small sum of money teaches college students the value of hard-earned money. Children who solely depend on their parents for their financial needs quite naturally take the money that they are given for granted. They may also tend to spend their money on useless things. In addition to getting the extra money, they can prepare their future career. College students also do part-time jobs to get some experience for future jobs. This experience will be very useful when they come to working in the real world, because they can get some experience that will relate to their next job. Finally, the transition between the studying and the working worlds is great. Many find it difficult initially to adjust to the working world after schooling. College students who have worked part-time will be more comfortable with the transition.
