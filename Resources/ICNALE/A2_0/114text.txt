I think having a part-time job is very important, because we are going to gain experience in our part-time job and we will earn much money. But many students think that part-time jobs are more important than studying. Nevertheless, I think that many people are going to have a part-time job. Part-time job experience is to be commended, because a part-time worker meets many people and gains experience. Here are some reasons why students should have a part-time job. First, the part-time job experience is going to teach sociability and allow them to meet many people. Because many part-time jobs are customer-facing these days, sociability is very important. Many customers like to have highly socially-skilled workers. Therefore, many employers choose to have employees with developed social skills. Second, the part-time job is going to earn much money. Many students receive pocket money from their parents, so they haven't any part-time job experience or experience earning money. When they receive earned money, they are going to be pleased. Finally, they get experience of many part-time jobs. These days Korea has many kinds of job, so students are going to get experience. When finding a full-time job, part-time job experience is very important. In conclusion, many students will have part-time jobs. And students study more, so they will survive in a competitive society.
