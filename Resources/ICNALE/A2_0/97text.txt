Part-time jobs have both positive and negative sides for college students. Part-time jobs can give experience to students, but they can also increase students' laziness to gain knowledge in lectures and prevent students from completing tasks well. Working part-time fosters a lazy mind, a desire to pursue money, and develops envy, spite, selfishness, and arrogance. Thoughts of chasing money are actually very good for the students future work when they need to demonstrate perseverance at work. I think the better part-time work is that directly supervised by the college, where the work is equated with the task of lectures. With that formula, students can feel how hard the atmosphere in employment is and foster independence while also becoming more cautious in their work. The students can also consult directly with the supervisor or lecturer of the course if there is a problem in the job. Part-time jobs that have been set by the college are not expected to disrupt the student's learning and will fostering positive thoughts. In general, I support the idea of part-time work for college students on the condition that the job will not lead to failure in their studies.
