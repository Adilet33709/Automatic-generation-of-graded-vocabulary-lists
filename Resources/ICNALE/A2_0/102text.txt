I agree, because restaurants are where individual people or families eat together. They are happy to give business, but if the restaurant has smoking, it will cause the atmosphere to stop being a completely free atmosphere. Restaurants are supposed to be clean. Restaurants need to focus on cleanliness because of the health of the customers. If the restaurant is a place where people smoke, when customers come to the restaurant, they would feel something bad, and it may result in the people in the restaurant to not eat healthily. A cornerstone of the restaurant business is to give customers an impression that depends on many things. The taste must be delicious and the environmental atmosphere of the shop must be good. This attracts customers into the store, where customers will feel comfortable and all ages can focus. The restaurant should not allow smoking to interfere with the dining customers. It can cause health damage to a customer. We should respect each other, especially the elderly, and sometimes there may be residual smoke in the food if you are smoking in the restaurant. Finally, banning smoking in restaurants is right and proper because restaurants are places for people who want to eat something good. They do not want bad things, so whoever enters restaurants should consider what their actions should be, and consider that smoking in restaurants would be wrong because it would destroy the health of people.
