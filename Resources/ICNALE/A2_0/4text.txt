For many years, smoking has been a hot topic for people all over the world. People always say that smoking is harmful to our health and that we should reduce the population of smokers. Nevertheless, should smoking be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country? My answer to this question is yes. On the one hand, smoking does less good than harm to our health. As a restaurant is a place of eating and drinking, if one person in the restaurant starts smoking, it will pollute the whole air of the restaurant. Those people around the smokers will not have the good mood to have their meals any longer. Some scientists say that second-hand smoke is more dangerous in many cases. We know that people in restaurants all want to be healthy. On the other hand, smoking in the restaurant may cause the restaurant to catch on fire easily. It is dangerous for us to have a meal in a dangerous place. I read some articles in the newspapers that indicated that some restaurants caught on fire because smokers threw their cigarettes into some places in the restaurants after smoking. Thus, because of the reasons above, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Let us keep our eating environments healthy.
