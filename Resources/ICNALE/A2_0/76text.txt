Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I would argue that people should have the right to choose whether they smoke or not. However, even though people should not smoke in a room where there are non-smokers, they should be free to smoke elsewhere. Smoking not only spoils a particular person's health but it also affects his or her entire family. It's a curse. Today we are all sensible and we know what the disadvantages of smoking are, but we must stop this poison spreading in our society, country, and home. In short, people should not smoke in public spaces. If I went into a restaurant, and while I was waiting for my food to come, I smelled the smell of smoke, it would ruin my appetite. In my opinion, smoking should definitely be banned in public places as it not only has deleterious effects on the nonsmokers present there but also may cause many people to cough. Besides, many youngsters who are fascinated by the act of smoking try to imitate it, which may later develop into a habit. All in all, smoking in public places is not good behavior. We should try to ban people from smoking in public places. To prohibit by law is obviously the best way.
