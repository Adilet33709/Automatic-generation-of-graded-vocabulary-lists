When students are available outside of school, it is a good idea to have a part time job. The benefits of having part time jobs are as follows. Firstly, students have extra money for school. Students can help their family by supporting themselves by earning money from their part time job. There are some places where students can do part time jobs when they are free during the week or weekend such as cinemas, food shops, etc. Many students can have income as college students and that is very good because they will be very proud of themselves. The extra money can also support their family because some of them may have some financial problems. Many students have to drop out of school because they must help themselves. Second, of course gaining experience is important. Presently, many companies require students to have experience, so a student that has experience is better than an inexperienced student is. The last benefit is making new friends. This is a small part but I think it's interesting to have new friends in a part time job. We can share our knowledge and share other experiences. We learn about and understand each other. It makes us more friendly and easygoing. So I think there are not only these three points, but many good points to having a part time job.
