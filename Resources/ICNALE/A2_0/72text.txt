Smoking is the personal right of each person, and each person also has the right not to breathe smoke or even face the dangerous consequences of smoking. Smoking should not be allowed in public places so that people who do not smoke do not feel uncomfortable; however, smoking is not good for your health so it should be prohibited. Many people still smoke in public places, especially in restaurants, where people need comfort and nutrition for the body. When there are people smoking, the comfort is reduced and people could risk many potential illnesses. It is not possible for restaurants to make rules that ban smoking because they do not want to lose their potential customers, so it would be nice if every restaurant had a special place for smokers who are already addicted to smoking so that customers who do not smoke will not feel uncomfortable in restaurants and customers who are comfortable with billowing smoke have special rooms. It would be better if no-one smoked because we cannot get any advantage from smoking, only losses. So, it is not easy to decide to ban smoking in a restaurant.
