In recent years, many people are talking about whether or not to ban smoking in restaurants. As far as I'm concerned, smoking should be banned in all public places including restaurants, because it has a bad influence on the health of people. On the one hand, smoking causes diseases in many people. We know from books that smoking harms not only the people who smoke but also all the people who sit around them. In some magazines, some scientists say that second-hand smoke is more dangerous sometimes than first-hand smoke. Many people die because of second-hand smoke. In restaurants, the people who smoke are harming the people who are having meals in the same place at the same time. On the other hand, smoking makes the air in the restaurants terrible. In our country, many times I have had meals in restaurants where someone sitting close to me has been smoking. It has made me feel uncomfortable but I never know what to do. I am sure that smoking is harmful to everyone. There is no denying that if smoking is banned in all public places like restaurants, most of us will breathe in fresher and cleaner air and have a happier meal. We would not have to worry about smoke in restaurants any longer.
