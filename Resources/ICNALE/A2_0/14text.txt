If students work part time, they should work a random schedule and not work illegally. It also is a good time to benefit because most students may not be as well off. It depends on money at home and working part time is part of helping alleviate the burden from home and training to recognize their responsibility. Money is for saving and some students of China want to be different and buy things not just with money at home, and some students merely sleep in rooms. I think finding jobs at department stores or facilities gives them time to practice the benefits of their own saving in a time of need. Working part time, we will more or less know the responsibility of having to work, but a student must see if work done manually is appropriate or not. If work is not appropriate to them it will result in bad or abusive work. Part time jobs that are both heavy and light have both advantages and disadvantages, and if a student is interested in part time work, too much may result in lessons. Working part time, because most of the work is very late, results in no time to read books and rest. Therefore, it is necessary for students to work part time if students know the best time to divide.
