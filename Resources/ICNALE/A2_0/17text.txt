The big problem in Indonesia is smoking because almost all people, especially men, always smoke. And they smoke wherever they want, not only in smoking areas, but they also smoke in public places, in restaurants, in rooms while they are having a meeting, and they do not think about the dangers of smoking in  public places. Because not all people, especially woman, like to smoke, they almost don't like smokers because smoking can disturb other people. You know why I say that smoking is a big problem in Indonesia? Because almost all of Indonesia's income is from smoking. Therefore, if the cigarette companies close down, there are many people who will lose their job and won't be able to pay for their lives. However, I agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. Why do I agree with that opinion? Because first, if we smoke, we have to spend our money buying cigarettes every day. Second, if we smoke in the restaurants, we will disturb other people who are eating there. Because the vapor of smoke can make our breath smell, especially for woman. While people will not forbid those who want to smoke, they also know which places to smoke. So, if we are in a restaurant, we should not smoke because we can disturb others, and we must know if we smoke, we can cause cancer.
