These days, smoking is banned in most public places and buildings. The problem is that there are smoking areas. They banned smoking, but they have smoking areas, which is ironic. Smoking should be banned in public places. Especially at restaurants. First of all, there are non-smokers. Non-smokers don't want to smell cigarette smoke. They are going to eat lunch or supper, not cigarettes. Even if smokers sit in their area, the smell is there, and I would feel like I was eating disgusted garbage. If you eat dinner with a smoker, it is a disaster. Because of the smoker, you will be in the smoking area. Non-smokers have to smell uncomfortable cigarette smoke. In my case, I really hate breathing another person's smoke. Second, smoking causes toxic diseases. As you know, smoking can cause lung cancer And can damage non-smokers' health more than smokers'. Non-smokers just want to enjoy their dinner, but they also receive a bad gift from smokers. Smoking produces all evil and no good. Some smokers say that if people don't like them to smoke, they can leave, but I think it would be better for them to quit smoking. Cigarettes are a kind of drug. I wish smokers would stop smoking.
