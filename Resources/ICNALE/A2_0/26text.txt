While academic studies are the main focus of college students, many will also spend their college years in part-time employment. Some reasons they do is that part-time work gives us financial advantages and introduces us to real work. First, part-time work gives students financial advantages. With the salary, you can learn to be independent, you can save your money, and you can help your parents, and it indirectly makes your parents proud of you. Second, with part-time work, the students learn about real jobs. It advances your skills. Many on-campus part-time jobs will give students the opportunity to learn administrative skills, such as phone and email etiquette, office electronics troubleshooting, and meeting manners. Gaining such skills while in school will place a student-employee ahead of the curve when they enter the full-time workforce. And then, experiencing workplace culture classroom learning is important, but the culture of workplaces and offices are hard to impart within the classroom. Holding down a regular position outside the classroom will allow students to gain firsthand experience of office culture and politics, which will be helpful upon graduation and in their first full-time job. The last reason is that part-time work requires you to balance your time. If you have leisure time you can get a job after you have studied. However, if you can't manage your time, you should not get a part-time job because it can decrease your academic scores.
