All students at university must use a lot of money because life at university is different from high school. We have many new things to pay for such as a lot of books for use when learning. Therefore we should have a part-time job because students like us must pay a lot of money not only to buy books but also we use money to buy clothes, travel with friends, and use for entertaining things. All students think having a part-time job is very interesting because we can have our own money and a part-time job can help us manage time and not waste time in the dormitory playing games or chatting online and sleeping in bed. If we have a part-time job at university I think it can help us for our future careers because we can manage time and service. A part-time job is very important for all students but it can damage us if we cannot manage time for both studying and a job. So if we want to have a part-time job we should make sure that we can manage time for studying and for our job and not fail at both. I do not disagree with having a part-time job but students should know what is beneficial or necessary for them to do.
