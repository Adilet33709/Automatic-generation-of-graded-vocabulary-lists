I think this is very important because college students have to work in the future, so if they can get some experience from a part-time job, I believe it is good for them. In a job, you can meet many different people, such as your colleagues, customers, and boss, you will go through many things with them, and you can learn a lot of knowledge and interesting things. Sometimes you can meet bad people, who can cause you trouble, but you have to stay calm, not get angry, and try to communicate with them. In this process, you can strengthen your mind. In addition, you can get money from a part-time job, which can lower home expenses, so, I support college students doing a part-time job. As an example, I have a part-time job in Carrefour in the summer vacation and winter vacation. One of my colleagues comes from the south of Taiwan, he is very interesting and funny and helps me understand everything. In the work, we can meet very many customers, someone can't find something, but the thing is in front of them, some can ask stupid questions, which are not related to my work, but after the question I can get a "thanks", which makes me feel content.
