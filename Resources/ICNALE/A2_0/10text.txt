I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country and I have three reasons to support my answer. First, I don't think we need to smoke in restaurants, because we go there to enjoy good dishes, not to smoke. Our purpose is not smoking. Second, I'd like to say that we can't enjoy the taste of dishes when we smoke, because the flavor of smoke is really stronger than dishes. I think we can't have a good lunch or dinner even if we go to a restaurant to enjoy dishes. Third, smoking is not good for health of the non-smokers who come to a restaurant. Non-smokers must breathe smoke when someone smokes in a restaurant, even if they don’t want to. Non-smokers must lose their chance to have a good lunch or dinner because of smoking. And smoke is not good for our health and taste of dishes, especially for growing children. So I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country Because we don't go to a restaurant to smoke, we can't enjoy dishes when smoke is present and smoke is not good for the health of non-smokers, especially children.
