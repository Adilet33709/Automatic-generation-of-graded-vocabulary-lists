I agree with this statement because smoking is a bad habit. As we know, smoking is an activity that gives no benefits and wastes our money. Smoking also makes people sick and causes serious diseases, not only for the smokers, but also the people who breathe in the smoke of their cigarettes. Smoking in the restaurant is also not polite because a restaurant is a place for eating. It will harm others. In the world, every year we can find 2.2 million human deaths because of lung disease. The disease is coming from many years of smoking. Cigarettes contain nicotine. If you think that nicotine is the only dangerous chemical in cigarettes, you are wrong! Nicotine can be absorbed into the blood. It makes a smoker feel relaxed because it is a neurotransmitter. It also makes a heartbeat, blood pressure, and adrenaline feel better. This makes a smoker want to smoke again. Cigarettes are made of tobacco, which is dangerous because it causes lung disease, heart disease, emphysema, and the other diseases. Some other dangerous materials in cigarettes include cyanide, benzene, cadmium, ammonia, and naphthalene. In all restaurants, smoking should be completely banned because it disturbs other people.
