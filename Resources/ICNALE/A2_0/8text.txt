I agree the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job, because I think that college students need to have the skills to work in adult society. Today, part-time jobs have spread to many areas of industry and have become important roles in these areas. Many companies want young people to work as part-time workers, so we who are college students, young men and women, have more chance to experience the difficulties of working in adult society. For example, I am working in Kobetsukan, a private school with lessons similar to those in a formal school, as a part-time worker. That is my first job as a job to make money and teaches me about the realities of being a worker in adult society. In the private school, I am called Mr/Ms NARUSAWA, and students see me as a professional teacher, but I cannot judge whether this is true or not. When I was seen as a professional worker, I could learn the meaning of working in adult society. It is that I have to play a role as the character other people expect me to. That I knew the mean is the biggest mean for working as a part-time job.
