I think that having a part-time job is important for college students because if we have a part-time job, we can increase our responsibility. Many adults say that students should study hard rather than spending time on part-time jobs. However, I think part-time jobs for college students are good because they can learn the importance of money and responsibility. The first reason is students can gain experience. Working experience is really important for getting a job. Also, students can learn to respect other people. The second reason is students can gain valuable insight about a career. Before I go into my real field of work, I need to learn skills and knowledge of the work place, and I want to see which job really fits me. The last reason is to earn money. Many people who are University students want to get their own money so they can buy pretty clothes and eat good food. However, we shouldn't only concentrate on getting money because we are still students. We have to focus on studying our subjects. Working for money might hinder our focus on studies because it takes a lot of valuable time. I think the best solution is to get money on vacation and study during the semester. I believe having a part-time job is very beneficial for college students.
