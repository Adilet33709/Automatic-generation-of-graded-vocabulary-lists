I think the topic is interesting enough to give a detailed explanation. In Indonesia, many people have different opinions about completely banning smoking at the restaurants. I will explain why smoking should be banned in restaurants. Firstly, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because the restaurants have AC, so this annoys people who come into the restaurants with their family such as children or an elderly father. Secondly, smoking in the restaurants makes the restaurants smell. Commonly in the restaurants, there is a different place for the smoking and no smoking areas so that nonsmokers will be comfortable in the restaurants. Thirdly, smoking in the restaurants is not good for our health. If customers are eating in the restaurants and they become unhealthy, of course this is a serious problem and needs to be quickly solved. If a young people man gets lung disease, the smell of a cigarette can worsen his disease, and the young man could die. This is a very serious problem. For the reasons explained above, I think smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country because smoking is not good for people's health.
