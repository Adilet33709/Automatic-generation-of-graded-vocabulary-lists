I do not agree with the point that having a part-time job is important for college students. Maybe some people think that taking a part-time job can help them in many respects—help them explore the knowledge outside of books and even gain financial independence. There are others who think that part—time jobs will have a strong negative influence on studying, as working often gives students strong pressure and becomes a burden. This might make students join fewer college activities. In my opinion, I think students should pay more attention to studying than to part—time jobs. A part—time job is a small priority for students. For college students, time is very limited and valued. If students spend their limited time on working at part—time jobs, there is no doubt that they will have less time for studying. They will also have little time for college activities. If someone thinks a part—time job will give them extra earnings, I am certainly against it. College is not the proper period for students to earn money. It is the best time for learning varied knowledge. If they gain some money now, they will lose a lot more in the future. To sum up, college students should not take part—time jobs when they are studying in college. Part—time jobs just make students lose their way or lose heart. For students, school work is more important than having a part—time job. Knowledge is power.
