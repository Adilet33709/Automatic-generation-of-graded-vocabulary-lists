At present, many teenagers use money  wastefully so some teenagers find methods to get more money to use. That method is a part-time job after school. Teenagers are trained about science and theories at school, but it is not enough to prepare them for adult life. Parents must think about a way to make them be older, tougher, and understand the wider world by the encouraging them to take a part-time job. Once in a while I indulge and spoil myself with something expensive. Since I was working, my mother declared that she was cutting off my allowance. When she was still giving me allowance, the phrase spending money like water was all too familiar with me. There was this a little store in the mall called Sanrio Surprises where all my money would flow. Anything new there was what I invested my precious allowance in. It did not even matter what it was or how I was going to get it. I just had to get it no matter what. The best reason for encourage teenagers to take a part-time job is to make them learn how hard it is to earn money.
