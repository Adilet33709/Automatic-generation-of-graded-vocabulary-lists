Studying and working part-time are activities that most students like to do together. Students have time out of the classroom to read, play sports, games, shop, and relax. Most students who work need money. What people want is to collect money to buy equipment, jewelry, clothing, sports stuff, phones, portable computers, wool caps, or tennis shoes. Helping students to work for compensation will enable students to think for hours and hours depending on how much they work or how easy or difficult it is. Therefore, students need to have a part-time job to meet demands. They can make money by themselves and for the experience of working with students in higher education. Before, students were responsible for only to having a quality personality in school. So many people look at college as an opportunity to socialize, to find themselves, and to explore the world before going out into it. College has been defined as a "safe place for young people to grow." Some students don't know the value of work experience and how it can enhance the educational experience. At least one semester of work would benefit ALL students.
