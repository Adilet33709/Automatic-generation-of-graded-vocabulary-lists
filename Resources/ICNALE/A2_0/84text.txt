I think that smoking must be banned at all the restaurants in the country because tobacco is very injurious to people. In restaurants, people eat food so many people do not like smoking. Moreover, the cleanliness of food is very important to people. In addition, passive smoking causes harm to other people. I want to say three reasons that smoking must be banned at all the restaurants in the country. First, when eating food, people do not like smoking in the restaurant because foods have their own taste and smell. In addition, smell of cigarettes is disturbing to other people. Next, cleanliness of food is very important. Food should always be clean and fresh. Therefore, the taste of the food will be delicious. However, if the neighboring table is smoking, we will think that is annoying and eat out in the restaurant. Last, passive smoking causes damage to other people. Passive smoking is very injurious to people, and its effect are worse than direct smoking.  Eventually, the damage caused by smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. Also, we must try to do not smoke in restaurants and should try to be considerate of others.
