I agree that college students should have a part-time job. Because if college students have part-time job, they improve socially. College students experience social life early. They improve socially more effectively than students who don't have a part-time job. As a result, these students will get a job and they can adapt more easily. Also, college students earn money themselves without their parents' help. Therefore, they will know that earning money is very hard and they will think that money is precious. They won't easily spend money and their parents' money worries will be reduced. Finally, the reason I agree that college students should have a part-time job is making friends. While they work part-time jobs, they meet many people. They can make many friends and they meet many diverse people, and they will improve their speaking skills. Because speaking skills are very important to their life, improving speaking skills is helpful. For college students, having a part-time job has many benefits. Therefore, college students should experience part-time work. A part-time job related to their major is more effective than an unrelated job. If college students don't disturb their study, their having a part-time job is very good.
