I disagree with that. To be sure, to have a part-time to live is vital for college students. But it isn't good to earn money for play. Generally speaking, college students have more free time than high school students and junior high school students. How to use their time all depends on them. Many college students spend a lot of time working part-time because they need to earn money to play with friends. Making many friends in college is good, however, but studying is also important. In college, there are many things to do, for example, taking part in an internship, a club, a seminar, and so on. So, college students should actively challenge how much they can do in college. By challenging themselves a lot, they are able to do their best with confidence when they work in the future. Wages of a part-time job are very low generally, and working part-time is very tiring for college students. So, it costs them a lot of time and effort to get money by working part-time. As a result, they can't often concentrate on a class and study for a test in college. It is not good for them. Therefore, I don't think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
