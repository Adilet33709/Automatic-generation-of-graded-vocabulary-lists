Today, more and more college students are taking part-time jobs. Different people hold different viewpoints. Some people agree with the idea that a part-time job is very good for college students. In my opinion, it is not so important for college students to have part-time jobs. I have some reasons to prove my point. Some people think that there are some advantages if students take part-time jobs because they can gain experience and build up their good character. Further, students can earn money from doing part-time jobs, so if they are from a very poor family, they can reduce their family’s financial burden. However, after-school work also brings a lot of problems. For example, some students think about their part-time jobs all the time and cannot decide that study is more important right now. As such, some students now have some problems with studying and some don't even go to class on time. As for me, I think the main task of students is to study hard and gain important knowledge. They can earn money later. Thus, college students need to know that studying is more important than working right now.
