When it comes to the topic of a part-time job, we normally relate it to teenagers, especially university students, nowadays. However, this phenomenon has been widely questioned by most people today, who think that the reason a student goes to a university is to study and gain knowledge instead of working and earning money. Hence, is a part-time job really good for a student or does it have a bad impact on the student? The answer is that it has pros and cons; it is only based on personal opinion. For me, having a part-time job consists of more pros than cons. For example, students who go for a part-time job can not only earn extra income but also learn how to balance their work and studies. They begin to learn how to manage their money well and, of course, when they are exposed to working life, they will definitely learn extra knowledge that is not taught in school. For example, the way they communicate with their colleagues is totally different from the way they communicate with their friends. In addition, they also learn how to be more independent and responsible. No matter how, most students go for a part-time job mainly because of financial problems such as they may have difficulty paying their tuition fees and so on. Thus, one of the fastest ways to solve their problem will be to get a part-time job. However, most of them normally face the problem of not getting enough sleep and being absent from their classes due to his or her part-time job. As a result, their performance in school may be influenced. In conclusion, getting a part-time job can be a controversial topic as it may be beneficial for someone who is willing to learn but disadvantageous for someone who is weak at managing themselves.
