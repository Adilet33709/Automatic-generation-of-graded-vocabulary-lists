I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. All people can go to the restaurants, and not all people smoke. There are fewer smokers. Therefore, they cannot smoke at any restaurant. For example, one family visits a restaurant. They are a family of four: father, mother, a boy, and a baby girl. There are many smokers, and smokers are near the family. We cannot defend our health, happiness, and freedom. Maybe, the young boy will learn to smoke from the smokers and the baby will breathe air with smoke from smokers. The young boy and baby could be your son or daughter, so it is very dangerous and makes you angry. Next, some countries use fire on tables, such as Korean soup, Japanese soup, and United Kingdom royal dessert. So, today, in restaurants with these foods, we can see fire on the table. If you smoke in this space, your cigarette ember is near gas. We know smoking near fires is very danger. I think if smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, smokers will never smoke in restaurants, and then all people there would feel happy, healthy, and avoid danger.
