Nowadays, many people smoke cigarettes. But most of the smokers are high school students. Smoking is really harmful for teenagers and adults. Cigarettes are bad for your health and are not good mentally. Cigarettes are the cause of various illnesses such as cancers and impotence, and cigarettes smokers know this already. And cigarette smokers give a negative sight. But smoking is not only bad for you. Cigarette smokers can derive joy from it and give a benefit to the nation because the price of the cigarettes includes state tax. And cigarettes also become a favorite food for the smokers. You can choose to smoke if you want. I think to say STOP SMOKING is not a good idea. If the smoker does not give damage for another people, I think we need not to say things like that. We can make a lot of smoking area for the smokers and the non-smokers. I smoke cigarettes too, but my father said it will be good for me to quit smoking cigarettes. I am considering quitting cigarettes. I think if I quit, I can save my money and my health. Thank you for reading my essay and I will study hard in English.
