I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. The first thing I don't like is the smell of smoke, and it has a lot of things that damage our bodies, for example, it is a source of cancer. At restaurants, everybody wants to eat food and enjoy time with family, and if they must eat food among the smell of smoke they will be really upset. People should have manners at restaurants, and we must not smoke at restaurants or public places. I think it is like a crime. It can slowly kill not only the smoker but also it can kill everyone who is around the smoker, for example, maybe their wives, sisters, brothers, and everybody around them. When I go to a restaurant, I want to eat and enjoy eating and if I meet someone who is smoking, I think that I will be really upset and angry. Therefore, I think every country should ban smoking at restaurants and maybe people who smoke should smoke before going to the restaurant. I think restaurants must be clean and fresh because restaurants are places to enjoy eating and relaxing. Restaurants may provide places for smokers to smoke if they still want to serve smokers.
