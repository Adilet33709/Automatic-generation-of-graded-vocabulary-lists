Nowadays many students have part-time jobs to pay for their college tuition. It's going to be a problem because we have to do it, especially at private schools. I think it is important for us, however there are many disadvantages. First, we are students. The most important thing to us is studying. The chance to have a part-time job is always around you however the chance to study is not always around you. For instance, consider someone who has started studying late. They thought that their part-time job is more important than studying, but they realized that they must study at the appropriate time. Therefore, a part-time job is not more important than studying. Second, we cannot concentrate on class. Generally, we do part-time jobs from the evening to late at night. Therefore, we cannot concentrate in our classes because of sleepiness. For example, I worked for a night delivery service from 10:00pm to 6:00am. It was so hard on the first day, but I adapted to the environmental change so I slept during classes. Therefore, part-time jobs disturb students' concentration in class. Consequently, part-time work has become a social problem. Many news outlets report it as a social problem, so the Government has adopted a wise policy to encourage students to concentrate on their studies. The problem can only be resolved by the Government because it's a hot potato for college students. We have to study for our future and part-time jobs are not our first priority.
