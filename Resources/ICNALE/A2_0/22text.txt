I agree with the statement. To be sure, we can smoke anytime and anywhere, but smoking should be banned at public places such as restaurants. As you know, smoking is not good for our health. Generally speaking, people who smoke in daily life become sick often. For example, smokers are apt to get cancer. In fact, there is a lot of data that a number of smokers are impacted by cancer. In addition to this, the health of surrounding people is also influenced by cigarette smoke. Smoke causes illness in other people who are exposed to it. Moreover, smoke smells very bad and makes people who are near a smoker feel bad. In a restaurant, guests would like to have a good time by eating delicious dishes in comfort. However, they can't do that near smokers because smoke makes them uncomfortable. There are a lot of restaurants that set aside a space in which people can smoke. It is a very good idea and very nice for non-smokers, but I don't fully agree with the idea because people who sit beside the border between smoking and non-smoking areas are annoyed. For these reasons, I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
