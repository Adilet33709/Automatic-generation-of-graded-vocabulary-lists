I think smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. It does not have any positive effects for the restaurant. It only can disturb the customers in the restaurant. Many customers will be passive smokers. Not only that, the smoke from the cigarettes will also poison the food and make people unhealthy. Passive smoking is more dangerous than active smoking. Passive smokers indirectly smell the smoke from the cigarette of the active smoker. The smoke is the poison, so the passive smoker is breathing in the poison from the cigarette of the active smoker. In many restaurants, there will be many children. If the restaurant is free of smokers, the children will smell the smoke from the cigarette. The food that has been served will automatically be poisoned because of the cigarette smoke, so the food will not be healthy. There is a solution if restaurant owners do not want to ban smoking from the restaurant, they must have a smoking area. A smoking area is a place for smoking. It is a closed room away from the main room, so the smoker can smoke freely in that room.
