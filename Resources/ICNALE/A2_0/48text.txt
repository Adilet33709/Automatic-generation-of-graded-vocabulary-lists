I agree with the preceding statement. This is because, I think that college students need a lot of money. I have two reasons for this. First, they should buy many books and read them. They can study a lot of things from the many books. If they go to the library, they can read many books, but they are forbidden from writing in the books from the library. I think writing in books for studying is very important. Therefore, college students need a lot of money to buy a lot of books. Second, they need to make many friends. To make a friend, they should belong to a club. On the club activities, they will need a lot of money. If they get friends, they can enjoy eating and drinking with their friends. On summer vacation, they can plan to have a trip overseas. I think college students need to study and play. A part-time job gives them not only the money but also the wonderful experiences. It is a  very precious thing working in society, and finding out various things. For example, they feel the importance of being responsible for their work and difficulty with getting money. I think college students should have a part-time job, and study a lot of things.
