I think cigarettes are the worst item in every situation. First, smoking does not look good. A person who is smoking looks like a gangster. Second, cigarettes are not healthy. But if a smoker is smoking I can't scold him only for smoking, because smoking is just his choice. Third, smoking on the road is very important. I have been this situation before. When a smoker is smoking while walking I was behind him. It was disgusting because he blew his cigarette smoke right toward me. In fact, I had never thought about smoking on the road before I went through this situation. But my mind has changed. The smokers who smoke on the road are very rude persons. But now I think just smoking is not right. Surely, if someone is smoking then another person suffers harm. So I can scold them because I am harmed by them. In accordance with these contents, I think all places must have a space for smokers only. Restaurants are not an exception. Besides, a restaurant is a place to eat, but if someone is smoking other people get displeased. So all smokers should be smoking in their place so as not to cause harm to other nonsmokers.
