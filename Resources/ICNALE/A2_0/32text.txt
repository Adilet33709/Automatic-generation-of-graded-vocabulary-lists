In recent years, college students taking a part-time job have become very popular in the big city. Many people believe that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. However, I disagree with this. I have some reasons to support my idea. Firstly, I think that everyone has tasks of varying levels of importance in different periods. For a student, studying is the key priority. If you cannot study well, you will be wasting your time. Secondly, lots of students want to lessen their parents' financial burden by taking a part-time job. However, this might have a bad effect on their studies. They do not know that the most important thing that their parents want is for them to learn well and live a better life after they graduate. Therefore, pay much attention to your studies now. The most important thing is not to have a part-time job right now, but learning professional skills and applying your knowledge into practice yourself are the most serious tasks during university. If you want to earn more money, this will really help you later. Thus, don't be influenced by others and try to keep gaining knowledge; you will succeed in the future as a result.
