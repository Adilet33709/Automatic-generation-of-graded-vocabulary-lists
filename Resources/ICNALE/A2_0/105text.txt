I agree with this statement, because having a part-time job is very important to learn about our society. My opinion is that it is important for high school students to study many subjects, such as math, English, science, Japanese, society, etc. Therefore, high school students should not work a part-time job. But college students must work after graduating from college, so while they are college students they should learn about working. Because of this, I think they should have a part-time job. If they have a part-time job, they can get some money. In addition, they can learn the difficulty and the importance of earning money. By getting some money they can travel extensively and go abroad to learn about other countries’ culture, leisure activities, language and clothing, etc. But they must not work too much, since their aim, as students, is to learn a lot of technical knowledge. I think they should not work more than four times a week, because working four times a week is more than half of the week. My conclusion is that college students should have a part-time job, but their main activity should be studying, so they must not work too much.
