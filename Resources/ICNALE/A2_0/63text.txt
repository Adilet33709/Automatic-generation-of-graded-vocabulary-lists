I disagree that smoking in restaurants should be allowed because smoking causes health damage. Dangers of smoking are getting diseases such as lung cancer and it can make people around you smell it at a restaurant. I don't hate people that smoke but I don't like to smell it. I can't breathe easily. I suffer very much from the smell. After they smoke and they leave, there is cigarette ash on the table. The next person will get ash on their dish. It's very dangerous and damages health. I am sure many people hate smoking but they don't speak out. I have tried to find the benefits of smoking but I can't find any. It may help people to relax or feel good, but I don't feel that. In my opinion, it's not a good idea to smoke if you have nothing to do. My friends think that it is cool and girls like it. I don't agree with that. If the restaurants allow people to smoke, it can't be a restaurant. It should be a nightclub or place to smoke. Food is not delicious and smells so bad. How can I eat there? Smoking should happen in other areas, not in restaurants. I support banning smoking in all restaurants.
