I agree that students should have a part-time job. As a student, they are more comfortable in life, so the parents must demand that their child search for a part-time job, as this is independence. Firstly, students will understand that making a living is hard and learn to increase income and decrease expenditure. For example, standing for eight hours in hot weather to hand out flyers to passersby is very tiring. So they will not only save the money in the bank but barely draw any money from the bank because money is hard to earn. Secondly, more and more college students choose to take part-time jobs in or outside school. At the beginning, they couldn't do well at all and often made mistakes. Gradually, they could do a very good job, and then they feel very excited when they receive a pay check for the first time. This encourages me to make up my mind to find another part-time job at every chance. Finally, students can learn how deal with the relationship between working and learning. If they can balance it well, they can think they are sure to get enough knowledge as well as work experience to prepare for future success.
