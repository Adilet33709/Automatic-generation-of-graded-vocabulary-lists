I think that college students'part-time jobs are important because of the tuition fees getting higher. Students' parents get in trouble paying all their childrenfs tuition. They find it difficult to afford all the tuition for four years, so most students have the responsibility to help their parents. But if someone who is not rich is thinking "I don't need to have a part-time job", then that person doesn't need to have a part-time job because doing a part-time job is optional, not compulsory. But I think that a person going to college should have part-time job for two reasons. First, they can help their parents who find it difficult to pay for their son's or daughter's tuition for four years. Of course, the money they earn can't cover all the tuition, but the money is not only tangible money. It shows care for their parents. And they can use the money they earned their allowance. We can see this as a small thing, but it is a big thing and a source of pride for them. Second, they can go through out of the college. That is important. It is easy to people who go to college thinking "I'm a just a student". But college students are not just students. College is one type of small society, so college students are members of society. So I think college students'part-time jobs are important.
