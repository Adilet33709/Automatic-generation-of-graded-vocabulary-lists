Nowadays, there are so many university students who not only go to their campus, listen to their teacher's explanation, do their tasks, and study, but also take a part-time job. University students do this to fill their spare time after they have finished studying at their university. By taking a part-time job, they hope they can get a salary to fulfill their university needs, such as paying for copies of papers, going to the Internet center to search for content for their homework, buying some books to support their reports, and joining a study tour, which is a program from their university to make a thesis. Besides getting a good enough salary from their part time job, they want to have experiences, challenges, friends, network, and enjoy their young life before they really start life in the working world. University students who take a part-time job would be wise to set their time between their duty as a university student and their part-time job. Actually, it is not easy, but when they decide to take a part-time job, they already thought hard about the positive sides and the negative sides. They also should have permission from their parents to get a part-time job. My friend works as private teacher in her spare time, and she is good at time management and enjoys her work. Because of that, she has become an independent woman, which means that a part-time job can sometimes have a good effect.
