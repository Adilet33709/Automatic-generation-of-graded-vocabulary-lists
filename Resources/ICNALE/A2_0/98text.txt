I think part-time jobs are very good for students. I will write about why. First, we can earn our own money. We can use that for eating, shopping or recreation. I can also help my mother with my university registration fees. Second, it can help us to experience our society. It will help you learn how to conduct yourself at your company and how to face your boss. Also, you can make friends at work. I can save my money for the future and to buy my parents birthday gifts if I save monthly, and not depend on my parents to be grown up. Nowadays university fees are very expensive, too, so that is why students look for part-time jobs. Another reason is society experience. Many people graduate with no social experience, and that can be problem when adjusting to working in a company. To face one's boss, it takes a lot of courage because the boss can fire you at any time. At school we have friends and at work we can make friends too. Making friends at work can help me adapt to work and teach me how to work well. These reasons are why I agree with students' doing part-time jobs.
