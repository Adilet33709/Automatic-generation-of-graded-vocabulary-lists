The costs students incur on campus are not small; every month can cost up to a million for meals, transportation, books, and cigarettes for smokers. The income of a parent who is an entrepreneur can sometimes cover this amount, but other parents need more than one income. Every student wants to cover the cost when they live far away from their parents. Some students who have many necessary payments on campus need to look for money by themselves, so they usually work at a cafe, do car washing, work as a newspaper agent, or work at an Internet rental shop. But sometimes, they have problems dividing their time, and they sometimes ignore their assignments from college. But, they feel proud they can complete part of their costs of college without asking their parents. If all students do this, surely all parents would feel proud but they must not complete all of the necessary things. Thus, if sometimes the parents' income is not enough to pay the campus costs, we have to get money by ourselves to cover everything from books to the boarding house without asking our parents. In my opinion, a part-time job helps students support their financial problems and I agree that students should work part time.
