Thailand has a lot of restaurants and stores. All depend on people to eat or shop for accessories and circulate together. To the owner of each store, health, cleanliness, and hygiene for clients is very useful. Currently, Thailand has enforced laws that prohibit smoking in public places in order to maintain the health of people in society. Smoking is carcinogenic and when people smoke cigarettes, smoke released into the environment allows people to inhale it with the air causing a health hazard. Therefore, banning smoking in diverse places is important and particularly it is appropriate to enforce the ban in restaurants as the atmosphere while eating is one important part as well. Restaurants in Thailand do not have a sticker on the door. Shops that have narrowed their angle for visitors or customers to smoke are clear and entering them is dangerous to lure people in that area. Whether there are some that do not follow rules and are selfish are more likely to be found by someone looking to pressure and make them follow the rules and enforce laws so it is beneficial to local people, or with no statewide smoking bans at all. I think it is a very good idea.
