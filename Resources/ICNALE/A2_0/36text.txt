At this time, many college students already have a part-time job. Part-time jobs are different from ordinary jobs. Part-time jobs have reduced work time, almost half of the normal work time. And the salary it is not as much as the salary of a full-time worker. The salary of a part-time worker ranges from Rp 100,000 (one hundred thousand rupiahs) to Rp 1,000,000 (one million rupiahs). It can exceed one million rupiahs depending on what kind of part-time job you have. I say it is important, because college students can get more experience before they enter the real world of business. College students can feel how hard it is to make money, so they become more mature naturally. Part-time work can increase students' skills if the part-time job they take is in the same field as their major. They can also improve their skills for managing time. If they take a part-time job, the students should arrange their part-time schedule with their college schedule. So, it will develop the college student's discipline. That's why is think a part-time job is important.
