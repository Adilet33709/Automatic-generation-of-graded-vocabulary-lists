As we can see, having a part-time job has become more and more popular among college students. From my perspective, this phenomenon is good. It is really important for college students to have a part-time job, as a part-time job may let students gain more experience, help them apply their knowledge, and allow them to know how hard it is to earn money. Firstly, it is important for college students to have a part-time job because they may gain plenty of advantages while working. They may learn how a job functions, how to work with their colleagues and boss, and how to be confident. For example, I worked for a TV program as a translator for a month, and I acquired the benefits mentioned above. Thus, a part-time job is really important for a college student. Secondly, it is important for college students to have a part-time job because they can practice what they have learnt in college. Practice is the only way to verify knowledge, and further practice can also help our studies. When I was working for the TV program, I really learnt a lot. I have to say that all of the things that I learnt there were really useful. Therefore, if a college student wants to gain more, he or she should go and find a part-time job. Lastly, it is important for college students to have a part-time job because a part-time job can help them establish the conception of money. They will soon learn how difficult it is to earn even $100, they will understand the value of money, and furthermore, they will understand their parents. In other words, college students can grow through a part-time job, they can practice their knowledge more, and most importantly, they can establish the right conception of money.
