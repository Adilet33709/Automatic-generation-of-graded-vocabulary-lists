I agree with the preceding statement. First, smoking is bad for one’s health. Those who like smoking will disagree, but smoking causes harm to all people, including non-smokers. People from the elderly to children all go to restaurants. At restaurants, people enjoy eating and talking. If people smoke in the restaurant, other people may think the food isn't delicious. They might have a sore throat and be unable to enjoy talking. I think that a restaurant must be a place that is comfortable for all people. In addition, completely banning smoking helps to stop smoking and improve people’s health. If the number of places that forbid smoking increases, smokers should put up with smoking a long time. Today, many restaurants in Japan separate the seats that allow smoking from the seats that forbid smoking. However, if we sit in the seats that forbid smoking, I feel uncomfortable because of smoke in the air. This is because the restaurant isn't perfect isolated. If someone says that smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, their reason will be that smokers would feel uncomfortable. One thing that I suggest is setting up smoking rooms in restaurants. It is completely private room, several seat in the room. I think we set up the smoking room in the restaurant, smokers can be satisfied, too.
