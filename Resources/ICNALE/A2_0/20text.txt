I agree that college students should have a part-time job. There are five reasons to support my opinion. Firstly, by holding a part-time job, they can find that earning money is very hard. Because of this, they will think seriously about how they use their money. College students have a lot of free time. If they want to travel abroad, they can make money by working in part-time job. Planning how to use money is helpful when they begin to work full-time. Secondly, if they have a part-time job, they can meet people from a variety of generations, from children to senior adults. Through this, they can know various people's way of thinking. Thirdly, the harder they work in a part-time job, the more they are rewarded. For example, their salary per hour may be increased. Fourthly, by doing many kinds of part-time job, they can learn their most suitable future job such as teaching children, serving customers in shops, and so on. In fact, I have a lot of friends who want to become teachers, and they teach junior high school students while they are studying. Lastly, they have responsibility for their job. Responsibility is an important thing to learn for when they work full-time. As above, they can learn society's basic rules. This is why I agree that college students should have a part-time job.
