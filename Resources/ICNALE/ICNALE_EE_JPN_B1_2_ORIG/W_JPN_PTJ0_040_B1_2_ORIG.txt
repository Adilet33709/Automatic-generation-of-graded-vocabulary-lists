I agree the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have some reason to follow this idea. First, part-time job is a good training of real work for college students. College students, have to work after they graduate their college. Then, experience of part-time job will help them. For example, if they work in office, they can learn using computer skill. Second, part-time job also gives students social experiences. Students learn how they should act in the society. For example, if the students work as waiter or waitress, they can learn polite word and good manner. It will help them when they are given an interview entrance examination of get a job. And, of course, in the company, it works very well. Third, most student do part-time job for that, they can earn money by the part-time job. They can use that money as they want. For some students, that is the first money they earn all by themselves. They can learn the value of money, they use, too. They can also learn how hard earn money and live in the future. By those reason, I think that having a part-time job is important for college students.
