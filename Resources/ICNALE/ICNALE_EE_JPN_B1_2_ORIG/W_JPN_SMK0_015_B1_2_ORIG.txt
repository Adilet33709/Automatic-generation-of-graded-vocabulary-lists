I strongly support the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Not only because I hate the smell of tobacco, but also because it is bad for all people's health in a restaurant. I have 3 reasons mainly. Firstly, because smokes of tobacco smell so bad for nonsmokers, it is so irritating to endure them. Even though some restaurants have the smoking sheets, smokes come to the non-smoking area and disturb us to enjoy the dishes. I always get a headache when I smell the tobacco and feel like to go out soon even the dishes are so delicious. As long as smoking has harm for others in public spaces, it should not be allowed at all. Next reason is the cost of restaurants. Because there are a lot of people who hate the smoking, restaurants have to separate the area to get customers. However, as I mentioned before, it is very difficult to separate completely and cost too much if they use high techniques like air curtain. It is quite better to prohibit smoking itself in all restaurants because it can be fairer with no difference in each restaurant. Lastly, even for smokers, smoking in restaurants should be banned. That is because smokers cannot stop smoking by themselves but it is sure they should decrease the number of tobacco for their own health. Actually restaurants or coffee shops are the best place for them to smoke in their daily life. If it is banned, surely they have to endure the hope to smoke until they come home or they find smoking space in a station and so on. Therefore it can be the benefit even for smokers in a long term aspect. From those all reasons, I think we should ban smoking completely at all restaurants.
