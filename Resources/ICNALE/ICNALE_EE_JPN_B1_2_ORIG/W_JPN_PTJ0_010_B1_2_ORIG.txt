I disagree with that opinion. I think that it is not important for college students to have a part-time job. There are two main reasons. The first reason is that students should study. What students have to do is study, but some students can't study enough because of their part-time job. For example, my friend has a part-time job to teach English for elementary school students. She looks so busy everyday to prepare for teaching. She often checks their answers in examination even during a class in the university. Also, she is likely to be late for a class because she has to prepare for teaching all night. I can't think it is good for her. In that case, part-time job prevents from her study. The second reason is that many students spend most salary playing, not living. They mainly spend their money clothes, their hobby, dating, traveling and so on. This means most of them don't work for living. For instance, my friend who I stated above is one of such students. She lives with her family and doesn't have to work. However, she wants to get more clothes and to follow fashion. In closing, I don't want to say students must not do part-time job, but it is not so important for them. Therefore, I think it is unimportant for college students to have a part-time job.
