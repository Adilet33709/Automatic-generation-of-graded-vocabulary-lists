I agree with this statement. I think smoking should be banned at all the restaurants. I have 2 reasons. Firstly, because of bad smell, people cannot enjoy eating at restaurants. Recently in most of restaurants, smoking area and non-smoking area is divided, but it is impossible to shut out smoke and bad smell completely. So some people who don't smoke have to endure bad smell from smoking area during eating. Because of the smell of smoke, sometimes the smell or taste of food is changed. So in order to keep the quality of food and people's rights to enjoy eating, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants. Secondly, smoke is bad for our health. It causes many kinds of disease, like lung cancer. For smokers it is totally voluntary harm to get disease, but non-smokers also have to breathe in smoke at restaurants for the same reason above. Moreover, side stream include more dangerous substance. Especially in restaurants, people often take their babies and children, and smoke has really bad effect for their physical development. So we need protect people around smokers form smoke in public space. Therefore I think smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan.
