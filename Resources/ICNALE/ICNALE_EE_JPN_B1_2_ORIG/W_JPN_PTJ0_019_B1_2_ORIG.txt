I agree with this statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have two reasons. In the first, many college students don't have money but they need much money for their food, clothing and shelter, playing with theirs friends, going anywhere and buying anything which they want. But when they use theirs money to buy something, theirs parents don't always give some money to them. So they need to have a part-time job. By the working they can get some money, also experience selling products and services and learn the difficulties in earning money. It is the first reason. The second reason is that the wage for the college students is cheaper than other workers. So if college students work part time, many companies and shops do without paying higher wage to employments. But now the condition of business is very bad in Japan. Some people think because of the college students part-time, many unemployed people miss their opportunities to work and the unemployed rate is high. Certainly the population of workforce doesn't contain the number of college students and the part-time by college students causes the rise of the unemployed rate. But it is said that business in the world is the worst for a hundred year. So when business gets good the unemployed people now will be able to get theirs works and the unemployed people will be less than now. By college students part-time, many companies and shops can decreased the payment of employee's wage. So I agree with the statement.
