I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have three reasons to support my stance. Firstly, a part-time job is an important chance to experience the society. Because a college is the place to prepare before going to the real society, part-time job is very necessary to know how severe working is or how we can enjoy it. In my experience, I learned that even one mistake cannot be allowed in a serves through working in bakery. I also noticed the importance of the relationship with my seniors. Second reason is a monetary problem. I think college students need a lot of money for texts or for some entertainments. However we are already adults and should not totally depend on our parents in finance. Therefore it is quite better to earn by ourselves as much as possible. As for me, I can live without working if I ask my parents to support me but I chose to work. That's because I have to learn to manage myself before graduating university. After I started to work, I actually became to think the importance of money when I buy something. Lastly, I think a part-time job is a good opportunity to get new friends. In a college, it is difficult to find so many kinds of friends because ages and departments are limited. However, if we work, we can meet any kinds of people regardless of ages or spatiality. I think such relationship is precious even after getting older. From all those reasons, I strongly believe that having a part-time job is important for college students.
