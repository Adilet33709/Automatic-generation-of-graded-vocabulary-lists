I agree with this statement. I think having a part-time job is important for college students. I have 2 reasons. Firstly, thanks to part-time job, students can earn money by themselves. For ordinary family, college fees are very expensive. And if students are living alone, much money is needed. So by doing a part-time job, they can help their family. Moreover, even for students in rich family, earning money is important because by using that money they can do many things. For example they can travel or study abroad. So in this meaning having a part-time job is beneficial for college students. Secondly, thanks to part-time job, students have social experiences which they never learn in school. For example, in food store or restaurant, they are taught manner and how to speak to customers politely. Such skills will be useful after they become working adults. Moreover they can learn how hard working is. It is said that in these days young people soon quit their job, but if they know about working before they graduate from college, they can endure even if their work is hard. Therefore I think that it is important for college student to have a part-time job.
