I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Of course, I have a part-time job. A part-time job must be a valuable experience. Many high school students are banned to have a part-time job. Even if they want to work, their parents and teachers ban to do. But, college students are free to do and have a lot of time. They should have a part-time job unless they are absent from the class because of it. Through a part-time job, I learned a difficulty of earning. Therefore, I learned to use money very carefully. This is an important thing in my life. Some people who did not have a part-time job when they are college students will not know the difficulty until they get a job. It is too late. People do not apt to forget things which they learned when they were young. My mother said It is very valuable for young people to have a trouble. So, we should experience many things and get a correct view, the right way to think and so on. They who acquired them will live comfortably from now. A great life waits for them.
