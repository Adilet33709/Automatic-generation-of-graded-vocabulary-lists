I think it important for college students to have a part-time job. I have two reasons about that. First, they need money. It cost a lot of money to enter a university. Of course, it is not they but their parents that paid the money. I believe they should pay back the money more or less to their parents, and some students want to go to a graduate school. In addition, generally, college students spend much money. For example, the money for buying nice clothes or shoes, hanging out with one's friends and playing club activity. For another reason, they can learn how the society is. Part-time job enables them how to make a good relations with other members or their boss. They attain kinds of skills and learn how strict and severe rule is. They will also learn how difficult they make money. You may say that if you do part- time job too hard, it causes bad effects to study in university. It is true but, actually, they have a right that they can control their own shift to some extent. If they want to earn a lot of money in a short time, they should work as a cram school teacher. Besides, I have a lot of friends, who work really hard, and get a great school records. That is why having a part-time job is necessary for college students.
