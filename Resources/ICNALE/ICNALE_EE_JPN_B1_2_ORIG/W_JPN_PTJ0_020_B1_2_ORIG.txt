I agree with this statement. Now I am the third grade student of university. When I entered the university, I had to have a part-time job because of needing money. If I do not work, I can not have fun in my college life, for example, drinking, travelling, buying clothes are impossible. If you want to enjoy your college life, money is really one of the essential things. That is why it is very important for college students to have a part- time job. By the way, I am sure that you can gain and learn a lot of things if you have a part-time job. In part-time job, you can see a lot of kinds of people, for example other university students and usual worker there. By communicating with such kinds of people, you can learn and be stimulated by them and possibly make friends with them. And also you can experience the first stage of social workers. When you become the third grade, you usually do job hunting. If you work at part-time job, you can talk with usual worker and see real work place and also notice the difficulty of working. In that meaning, experiencing a part-time job help you job hunting. That is why I strongly believe that it is really important for college students to have a part-time job.
