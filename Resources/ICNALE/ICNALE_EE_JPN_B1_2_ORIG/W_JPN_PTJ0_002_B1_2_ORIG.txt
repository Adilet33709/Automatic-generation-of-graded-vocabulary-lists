I agree this statement that it is important for college students to have a part time job. I think the best way to learn the money and the society is to do a part-time job. In doing a part-time job, college students learn the money and the society and understand how difficult to earn money is. And college students learn the society which is not in the school. More and more college students are doing a part-time job, they are able to prepare the future life when they work for their families. If college students don't a part-time job and don't know what a life is, they have great difficulty in working. In college year, manager don't claim college students heavily if they make a mistake. But in company, manager claim them heavily. To get used to work and earn money, college students need to do a part-time job. College students need to do a part-time job to know what a life is. So I agree this statement that it is important for college students to have a part time job.
