I agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It is because smoking does harm not only the smoker but also people around him or her. It goes without saying that smoke is gas. Though we can separate sheets, we cannot separate gas. If case a smoker sits in a smoking section, and you sit in non-smoking section near him in a restaurant. The more he smokes, the more you take. In addition, we can reduce the costs and time if smoking is banned. They will not need to buy plates which catch ash, and to clean them. You may say that this is too strict for smokers, but if they really want to smoke, they should go to a smoking room that stops the gas from leaking out. I believe this idea sounds so nice for both smokers and non-smokers. And these days, the number of people who smoke is reducing in Japan. The price of smoke is getting higher and higher, and it is troublesome to get even a pack of cigarette in Japan. Then, how about extinguishing cigarettes? They just do not have any good aspects. They just harm our health. In one of the ways, we can get rid of the smoking sections in a restraint in Japan.
