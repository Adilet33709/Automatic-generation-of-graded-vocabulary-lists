I agree with this statement. At all of the restaurants I have ever been to there is no wall between smoker's seats and smoker's seat. So I want to explain about only such kind of restaurants. First of all, I want to explain about one reason. Recently in more and more restaurants, smoking has been completely banned in Japan, however there are still two kinds of seats, smoking and non-smoking in one restaurant. I am not the smoker, so I will chose the non-smoking seats. But even if I sit on that seat, I often feel bad because of flowing the smell the smoke. Smell of the segarate is very strong. That is why smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Secondly, I have ever heard that sub-smoke of segarate is much worse than main-smoke. That means that smoking have a worse effect on non-smokers at one restaurant than smokers. I think it is unfair for non-smokers. I think smoker should smoke out of a restaurant or in one smoker's room. It is fair and reasonable. Smoking is bad for your health. I am sure that we have to discuss good or bad of smoking before thinking about banning smoking at restaurants. That is why I strongly believe that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants all over the world not only in Japan.
