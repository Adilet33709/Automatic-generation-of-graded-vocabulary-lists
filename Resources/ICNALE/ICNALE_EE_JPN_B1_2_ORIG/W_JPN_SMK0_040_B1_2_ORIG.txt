I don't think that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in Japan. I have some reason to follow this idea. It is true that smoking hurts human's health and smoke of cigarette hurts non-smokers. But, smokers have right and freedom of choice and smoking. Only forbidding smoking isn't make smoker's smoking manner more better. Of course, non-smoker's health is really important. Smoking without manner will make a lot of conflicts. I have some ideas to solve this problem. First, distinguish smoker's seat and non-smoker's seat more strictly. Almost all restaurants, of course, distinguish them already. But, most restaurants distinguish them only by space. I think it is not enough. I propose separate these places by wall. By doing like that, smokers can smoke as well as they can, and non-smokers don't have to worry about the damage of their health caused by smoke. It doesn't have to take much tax, only a bit will work. Second, take more tax to the cigarette. If smokers need more money for smoking, they will restrain from smoking a little more, at least, in the restaurant. From these reasons and solutions, I think it is too strict that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in Japan.
