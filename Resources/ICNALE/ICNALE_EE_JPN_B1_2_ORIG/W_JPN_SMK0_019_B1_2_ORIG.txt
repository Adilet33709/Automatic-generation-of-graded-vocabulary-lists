I disagree with that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Certainly many people who don't smoke don't want to eat in the next of smoking people. I agree with this thinking. But by banning smoking at a restaurant smoking people don't stop by it to eat and drink. It makes two bad things. In the first when smoking is banned at all the restaurants, smoking people can not eat out. Then they can't eat something in their favorite restaurants. It makes them unhappy. And when smoking people don't eat in restaurants, the number of guest who comes to restaurants is less than ever. Then the profit of the restaurant decreased. I think that it is very inconvenient for the restaurant. So I disagree with that smoking should be completely banned. But we should consider of people who don't smoke. Therefore I think that smoking should be in part banned at all the restaurants. Restaurants have the part of space where people can smoke and the part of space where people can not smoke. By doing that both of non-smoking people and smoking people can enjoy theirs dishes. So I disagree with that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country but I agree with that it should be in part banned.
