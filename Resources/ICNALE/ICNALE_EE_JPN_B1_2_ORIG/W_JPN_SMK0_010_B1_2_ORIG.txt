I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are two reasons, health problem and manner. First, smoking makes health problem. Smoking isn't good not only for a smoker's health but also for other people's health. If a smoker has disease like cancer in his lumps by smoking, it is his responsibility. However, if a person who doesn't do smoking becomes in such situation, he will want to claim about it. Of course, we can't know all such disease is caused by smoking people. But there is possibility to become disease in the future when someone smokes at a restaurant. Second, it is manner not to smoke in public space in today's Japan. Smoking makes a lot of people feel bad, so not to smoke in public space is good manner. But, do we have to ban smoking? There is a good example. You will not do makeup in a train because it is manner and it makes many people feel bad. But some people do makeup in a train though they know it is bad manner. It is same as smoking. If we don't ban smoking clearly, some people will smoke at a restaurant in spite of knowing that many people hate it. For these two reasons, I think that smoking have to be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
