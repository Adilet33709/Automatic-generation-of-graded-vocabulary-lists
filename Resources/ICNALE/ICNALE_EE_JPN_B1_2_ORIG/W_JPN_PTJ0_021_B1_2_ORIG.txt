I agree with the idea that it is important to for college students to have a part-time job. I want to explain the two reasons why I think that college students should have a part time job. The first reason is that college students should really know value and difficulties of getting money. People need money for living. A lot of money are needed for one person to be grown-up. Basically, college students depend on their parents especially in money. But most of students don't know their parents' hard work to get much money for their children. I think they should know how hard works are needed for getting just a little money through part-time job as well as their parents have. Next, what I want to tell you for the second reason is that college student can learn a society through part-time job. Common sense as working people is really essential for business, for instance, how to communicate with other people in business and how to talk. Part time job could be only one place that student can learn about society as working adults. Student can communicate with working people in part time job to learn. For these two reasons, I agree with the idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
