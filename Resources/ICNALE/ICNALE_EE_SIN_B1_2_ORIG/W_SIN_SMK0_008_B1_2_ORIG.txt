I disagree with the statement. Although I am not a smoker, I have friends who are smokers and I empathize with their situation in Singapore, where there are many areas that are out of bounds to smokers. There are even fines if one smokes at bus stops or in other non-smoking areas. Smoking in restaurants can affect many diners, especially if the smoke "interferes' with their consumption of food. I do agree that it can be uncomfortable for diners and perhaps even irritating. However, I argue that to completely ban smoking in all restaurants is unfair to smokers. There should be a smoking corner or a smoking room instead, which can greatly help smokers take a break and relax in between their meal times. This will definitely be more appreciated than to ban smoking in restaurants entirely. It also infringes on their right and freedom to smoke, which is ironical, especially in a country that promotes freedom and equality. Should the government want to completely ban smoking in a particular area, then why do they even allow the sale of cigarettes in the first place? It is this irony that exists in public places that create confusion and conflict among people, and smokers in particular.
