Despite the fact that the media tells us that science has proven that smoking kills, smoking will make us ugly, smoking will only make us less appealing, many people still continue lighting up their cigarettes. However, what exactly has science proved? Scientists have never successfully proven that smoking leads to cancer, and cancer will kill us, therefore, smoking will kill us. It has only been a hypothesis, but we fail to understand that statistics do not postulate the truth to scientific theories. Consider the hypothesis: 80% of people who eat broccoli die of cancer. It seems very intuitive to say that broccoli causes cancer, which we realise to be a very absurd claim. What we fail to consider upon first glance is that the number of people who eat broccoli is very high, and this large group of people are as subjected to getting cancer as any other people due to all sorts of factors, be it genetics or anything else. It seems that practically anything around us can give us a diseases and kill us, including using our hand phones or drying our hands with the hand driers in public toilets. So, if smoking is what you enjoy, light up.
