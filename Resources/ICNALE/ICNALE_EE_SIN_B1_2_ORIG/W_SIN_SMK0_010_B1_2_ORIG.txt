I think smoking is really a bad habit to be having. I have always hated the smell of smoke and detested walking behind people who were smoking as being a Singaporean student, we have always learnt about the negatives of being a passive smoker. More importantly, I feel very sad for each and every smoker was I walk pass them. I really hope that they would stop smoking as it is really harmful to their bodies. On top of them, they are unknowingly hurting everyone around them by making them passive smokers, or polluting the air. I hated it when I found out that my friends were smoking. I told them to stop but till today, I am not truly sure if they have stopped smoking. I really wish that they did. I do not see any positive about smoking actually, it wastes money as they are in fact really expensive and it does harm. I sincerely hope that in the future, less and less people will be smoking cigarettes. My father used to be a smoker according to my mother when he was in his younger days. Thankfully he stopped smoking before my parents got married. Since my father could stop in the past with no forms of rehabilitation of stop smoking campaigns, I feel that this generation smokers should have it easier by finding help to stop smoking. "If there is a will, there is a way" as quoted, hence I feel that it is important for us to all to continually encourage our love ones to stop smoking.
