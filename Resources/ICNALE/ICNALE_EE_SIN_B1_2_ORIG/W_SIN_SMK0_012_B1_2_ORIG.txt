I agree that bans on smoking should be placed on all restaurants. Smoking is detrimental to the health to the smoker himself and the people around him. Moreover, a large number of restaurants are within an enclosed space or building. For example, if smoking was allowed on McDonald's premises, then a lot of children would inhale second hand smoke and if it starts so young, it can cause lung cancer in the future. Also, bans are merely placed on all restaurants; it's not the entire country. Smokers can still have their puff after their meal. Surely they are not that addicted to smoking such that they can't spare a good 10-20 minutes for their meal. From the business perspective, I would have to segregate areas for smokers and non smokers as having a smoking area might play a part in deciding on where to dine. This is costly to the business either way. Without the smoking area, you might lose customers who are smokers. With the smoking area, you lose customers who don't appreciate the smoking. And just having two different areas, it costs more to have two different sections. E. g. Having an indoor and outdoor area. This means higher cost for a larger space as it's not possible to segregate 2 distinct areas in an enclosed place. But without the ban on the restaurants, you are able to sell the cigarettes which could boost sales. Overall, it's better not to be placed on restaurants. It benefits the general public and the smoker.
