A lot of students hold part-time jobs, even when they are not on their school holidays. Sure, part-time jobs give us extra money to spend because as youths, we seem to always want more things than we can afford. We do not want to burden our parents further by giving us more money, so we get jobs. However, some students get too obsessed with the idea of making money that they sometimes forget that their top priority as a student should be to concentrate on their academics. They take up more shifts, sacrificing valuable and limited time that they should ideally be using for their schoolwork or to study. If the need to make money is so strong because they need to buy so many things, then perhaps it is time to let go of a materialistic lifestyle and learn to be happy with what they already have instead. Part-time jobs teach us responsibility, but it should not be the case that it affects our performance in school. In the future, we will have the rest of their lives to work. By then, we will regret that we did not spend the time we had busying ourselves with school instead.
