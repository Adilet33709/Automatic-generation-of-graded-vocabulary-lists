My part-time jobs have been very unique and different from the norm. I do not go to companies to work as a admin stuff during my weekend, but instead I have been working as a tuition teacher, and a kinder gymnastics trainer. I enjoy both of my jobs very much as not only does it pay well; it also is really fun and interesting to interact with the children. Their ages for the kinder gymnastic classes ranges from pre-nursery to k2s. the kids are extremely cute when they recognizes you and try to be close to you. The small talks with them have also been very interesting. They are simply hilarious. The tuition children that I teach ranges from primary five to primary six. I would find this job more tiring but nevertheless, they are still interesting people. I remember feeling extremely lazy to go and teach tuition after a long day in school. However, I still had to be responsible enough to go. Also, many a times I wanted to skip tuition as I had a test/exam the following day; however, it seems as if their exams were more important than mine. In the end, I still had to go and teach them. However, it was satisfying when you see improvements in their grades.
