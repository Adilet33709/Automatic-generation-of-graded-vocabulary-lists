Personally I feel that it is good for students to have part time jobs, especially when they are studying in a polytechnic or university where the students have long breaks. For poly students like me, we have many breaks in a year. For example, we have these 6 weeks in around August for us to go out to work and earn money for us to buy our textbooks and to pay for our expenses. This way, we do not have to rely on our parents to give up all the pocket money. Having this part time job can also allow us to learn how to be independent and know the difficulty of earning money so that we will not squander our parents' money away by spending on things that are not necessary. By having a part time job, students are also able to learn social skills and how to interact with other people and try out the different kinds of job until we find one that is suitable for them. We can also know what are our forte and what field should we work in when we graduate from our tertiary education. Therefore, overall, I agree that students should have a part time job. Even a not so time consuming part time job is suffice.
