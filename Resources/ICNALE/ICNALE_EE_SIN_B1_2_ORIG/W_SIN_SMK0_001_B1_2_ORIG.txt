I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. The basis that smoking should be completely banned is that the smoke produced from smokers are proven to be hazardous to health and it can be a nuisance to restaurant-goers as smoking is a form of air pollution. Firstly, scientific studies have proven that second-hand smoke - smoke produced from smoking - pose a bigger health threat than smoking itself because the smoke produced contains more carcinogens and unfiltered chemicals than what is inhaled by the smoker. Allowing smoking at restaurants would expose health threats to everyone especially more so for children and the elderly. Most restaurants are are-conditioned and this makes it worse because there is no ventilation of the smoke produced and it is inevitable that restaurant-goers would have to inhale and bear the smoke produced. Secondly, smoking is an air pollution and can disrupt restaurant goers from enjoying their meal and company. Most restaurant goers would simply want to enjoy the ambience of the restaurant without having to deal with the unnecessary smoke or the unpleasant smell that smoking produces unless they are smokers themselves. For the greater public good, smoking should be banned completely at all the restaurants in the country as restaurants should be respected as public places equivalent to hospitals, schools and airports where the smoking ban has already been imposed. Also, it is not completely unreasonable to ban smoking completely at restaurants because there are other more suitable and appropriate areas for smokers to smoke.
