I disagree that having a part time job is important to a college student. The average Singaporean college student would be bombarded with huge amount of work. Where in the world would a student find the time to take up a part time job? It requires a lot of time and effort for such a commitment. A college student without much skill would be left to do manual labour and paid low wages. Time is very precious to a college student (in contrast to a secondary school student), and the amount of time and effort is simply not worth a few bucks per hour. However, should the student have spare time on his or her hands, it would be good to get a part time job. Having a part time job allows the student to get a taste of the working world and it could be useful in the future when applying for a job. Also, additional income wouldn't hurt anyone. A part time job would be more suitable if it's during the school vacation. Having a job during school term might cause burn out. The student might go to class feeling tired or a lower concentration, affecting his/her studies. It's more important to focus on studies so that we are able to carve our own careers in the future.
