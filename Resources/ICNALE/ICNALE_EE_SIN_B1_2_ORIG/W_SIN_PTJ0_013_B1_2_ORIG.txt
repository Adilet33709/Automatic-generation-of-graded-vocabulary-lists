Yes it is important to have a part time job. A lot of people think that working while one is studying is tough work, that one's studies necessarily suffers. However, in my opinion I feel that having a part time job enriches one's life, not just in material terms, but in non-material terms. One takes away life's lessons, such as diligence, patience, team work and social skills. This benefits the person for the entirety of his life, and so it is always better to start early. College students are at the point of their lives where they are the most malleable in terms of their psychological outlook, so having them undergo some life lessons will definitely allow them to benefit for the rest of their life. The students also receive monetary benefits, which is always welcome, because tuition fees are always escalating, as with the cost of living and one's financial responsibility to support his/her aging parents. Therefore it is imperative that students, wherever possible and physically able-bodied, be able to contribute to the household income by working part time. One can also learn more skills on the job, and gain valuable contacts that can put him/her in good stead in future job hirings. In my opinion, some are born with a silver spoon, and will never work part time. These are people who will never gain an appreciation for life.
