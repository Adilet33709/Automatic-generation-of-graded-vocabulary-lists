In my opinion, smoking should be banned in all restaurants in Singapore. The reason is that I feel smoking brings much harm to society, in the form of multiple diseases and health risks to both the smoker and the people inhaling second hand smoke. By banning smoking, we can cut down health care costs, because less people will fall sick from such smoke, therefore there is less strain on the national health care system. Banning smoking also allows all diners to eat in peace, such that their appetites are not ruined from inhaling poisonous smoke when they are eating at the same time. In my view I think that smoking is not a bad thing itself, if smokers know the risk to their health and they choose to do it. But the key thing that they should take note is that the smoke can possibly harm all the people that inhale the smoke, including his family that most probably sits closest to him. Therefore, by banning smoking, the law will actually help to protect his family members from health risks. In conclusion, I feel that smoking should be banned, simply because it is reasonable to not want to inhale second hand smoke, and as a non-smoker, we should have the right and privilege to not inhale smoke. I value my health highly and do not wish to compromise on it.
