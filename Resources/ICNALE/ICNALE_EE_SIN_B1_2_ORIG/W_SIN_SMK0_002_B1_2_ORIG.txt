Applying the Utilitarian perspective, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. This is because there is overall harm if smoking is not prohibited. Smoking produces a foul smell that some people dislike. Consumers will not wish to dine in an environment that is uncomfortable. Furthermore, not only is smoking harmful to the smoker, it causes more damages to the people around them. Second-hand smokers have a higher probability of contracting lung disease. While some may argue that this is only likely if the person is exposed to second-hand smoke for a long period of time, if smoking is not completely banned, consumers are likely to encounter smokers meal after meal. This will then be detrimental to their health. Consumers include children and elderly and this can cause more damages to them. In addition, if smoking is not banned by law, restaurant owners can face difficulty in declining to offer service to smokers. Consumers may be deterred from entering the restaurant and hence causing the restaurants to suffer losses. These disadvantages of allowing smoking in restaurants outweigh the advantages. If smoking is not completely banned, smokers will be able to exercise freedom in enjoying their puff of smoke. This will be in accordance to the human rights. In conclusion, given that it is more beneficial to ban smoking, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country.
