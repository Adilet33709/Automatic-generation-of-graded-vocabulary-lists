I agree with the statement. College students are mostly in their 20s and are adults with a social life that requires money, such as going out for dinners or shopping for clothes. Therefore, having an income (even a small one) will be useful for college students in ensuring that their social life is not compromised during the school term. Moreover, having to rely on parents for additional income can be a little embarrassing and may put a strain on their financial resource. Therefore, I feel that it will be better for college students to have their own income. While it can sometimes be tough to manage one's time, especially with assignments and other school commitments, one still has the opportunity to be flexible with his/her part-time job, by taking less shifts or quitting it since there are not obliged to continue in the long term (as a last resort). Part-time jobs that enable flexibility are providing tuition or working on an ad-hoc basis such as modeling or screen-writing. I therefore conclude that it is imperative that college students have a part-time job in order to keep up with their social lifestyles and not burden their parents, some of whom may already be retired.
