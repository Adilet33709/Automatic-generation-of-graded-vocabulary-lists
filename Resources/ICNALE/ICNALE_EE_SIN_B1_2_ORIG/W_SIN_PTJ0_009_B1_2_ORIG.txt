I worked as a part time tutor after finishing national service. At first I had trouble getting back into the hang of academic subjects, as I had basically spent two years in my camouflage uniform and looking at guns all day. I also felt a little frustrated, as I had already mastered these two subjects, namely Mathematics and Chemistry, back in my junior college years, and I could not understand why all my knowledge had basically disappeared in the short span of two years. So in addition to my monetary income, I had another reason to pick up my lost skills again, as I had to prove to myself that I did have the concepts contained in those two subjects within my reach. In addition, I had the chance to reinforce those concepts in the process, as by teaching my student verbally, I was rehearsing my knowledge of the subject matter and solidifying my grasp of said concepts. Altogether I had a very enriching experience being a private tutor, as I loved learning and academia in general, and in the process I developed important interpersonal communication skills, for example being articulate and patient. Of course, having a stable source of income did not hurt either.
