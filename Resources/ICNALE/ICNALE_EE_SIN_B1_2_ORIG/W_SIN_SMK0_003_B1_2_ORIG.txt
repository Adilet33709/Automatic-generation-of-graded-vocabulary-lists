As we all know, smoking is bad for health and even if it is shown in many advertisement, campaigns and even on cigarettes boxes, not many people are paying attention to it. In fact, it has becoming more and more popular. Even though government has set up a smoking area at certain part of a location, certain restaurants are also providing a smoking area for their customers so that they will be able to smoke and at the same time contributing to the sales. Therefore, it does not just benefit the smokers by providing convenience but also to restaurant s sales. Smoking is a bad habit of humanity, it does not just hurt the smoker himself but also to the surrounding people who might end up being a second hand smoker. Smoking should be banned in all restaurants because if restaurants provide smoking area services, it will tend to attract more smokers to patronize their restaurant thus, hurting themselves even more and also to the public who might got a chance in being a second hand smoker. Gradually, smokers tend to depend on smoking even more and non-smoker might get influence and join them and it will become a serious problem in the near future. In conclusion, taking everything into consideration, smoking should be banned in all restaurant in the country.
