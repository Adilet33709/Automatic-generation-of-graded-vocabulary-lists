Having friends who smoke, I believe that it is okay for the restaurants to allow smoking. However, they should put a boundary to draw a line in between the smoking and non-smoking areas. This way, the smokes would not affect the non-smoking customers. The smokers can also enjoy their dinner at the restaurants with their friends without having to bear with the pain of not being able to light a cigarette. However, the problem of the smoke lingering in the air-condition restaurants is a cause of concern. The smoke may stay in the restaurant for a very long time and it will be very difficult for us to get rid of the smoke. Therefore, if the restaurants want to allow smoking, they should have a partition to separate the smoking and non-smoking area. They should also make the smoking area non air-condition so as to prevent the smoke from lingering in the air and causing air pollution. It will also affect the health of the workers who are there to deliver the food or clean the place, as they will be taking in second-hand smoke. If the restaurant wants to legalize smoking, they should be considerate to the non-smokers who want to enjoy a peaceful dinner with their dates.
