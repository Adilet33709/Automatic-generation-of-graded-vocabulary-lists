Smoking is bad for health. Smoking causes lung cancer. Smoking causes heart disease. Of course I know that. As if the hearty, overzealous anti-smoking campaigns weren't doing enough to curb this unhealthy habit, they insidiously wove this schtick into the curriculum. Case in point: Biology class in Secondary 2. We learned how tiny smoke particles bind irreversibly with red and white blood cells, and are carried throughout the body, effectively spreading the harmful substances all over our body. Please, if I ever need a poignant reminder of aforementioned harmful effects, I would just buy a pack and stare at the tasteful illustrations of gangrenous tissue ravaged by years and years of chain smoking. But wait, what is inside the box- holy sh*t! Aha, what a shame it would be to see these twenty perfectly new and viable cigarettes go to waste. You see, no one talks about the other side effect of smoking. You feel good. No, I correct myself, you feel bloody good. It was as if a low rumble of euphoria washed over your entire being, not unlike the high from alcohol, except slower. It is also a great tool for socialization. Imagine petty little deviants like me all congregating in those stupid yellow boxes, packed like sardines, puffing away. Yup, the government has made it illegal to smoke freely in public places, except for those tiny yellow boxes demarcated "smoking corners". What the f*ck. As if we have no rights to speak of. Oh wait, this is Singapore.
