Part time job is a kind of job which is in addition to the job or business a person is doing to increase his income than expenses or to meet his expenses. For instance, a person is clerk in an office and he gets free in the afternoon and is known as clerk in his community. Now, if he starts another job like a mobile shop from after noon to night, he is doing a part time job. There is a need of part time job in two cases. First, a person doing part time job may run short of his income having more expenses. Second, a person who is not running short of income but wants to improve his life by getting car instead of a bike, house instead of living at rent, daily fruits rather than weekly eating etc. Part time job is hard job and always done with short time frame of mind. I mean people always start such jobs with an intentions to leave that job after achieving some temporary targets like marriages of daughters or studies of children etc. Most of the time part time job is not more than six hours and people are not professional in such jobs. It is common in the countries where inflation rates are high or people are showy. They want to meet the self created useless standards in the society and for that purpose they get into such jobs. There is a loss also that we can't pay time for the basic purpose of coming in this world that is to pray. Especially being muslim one should realize that we are to pray and to make others to pray also as no prophet to come now and we are responsible to preach the reason of being sent to this temporary world. In this context, part time job is just wastage of time, not always as someone doing in need, as people should control their desires.
