Part time jobs are the jobs or works that people do besides their daily work routine and life. If a student goes to school, college or university in morning and do something to earn money in evening, he is doing part time job. If an employee work in an organisation in morning and do work somewhere else in evening, he is doing part time job. Now the question is why people do part time job? A major reason is that they want to make money to earn thier livings. Today is the time when inflation rate is increasing day by day and it has becoming impossible even for a family head of upper middle class to maintain their status and keep their lives going smoothly. So they do parts time jobs. Students do it just to help their family, make their own pocket money or for the sake of experience, exposure and feel of independence. It makes them aware of practical world and show them its glimpses. Now as far as matter of payments of part time jobs is concerned, its not very satisfactory. Some mills and organisations pay very fairly. For example Interloop, a knitting industry, pays their workers if they stay in mills after 5 to complete their work. But some oganisations cruely exploit their employees. To conclude with we can say, part time jobs are need of time. One must full fill one's needs with one's own efforts. As working ourselves is far more better than begging others
