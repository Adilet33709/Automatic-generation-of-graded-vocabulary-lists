 Since the mankind has come into existence ALLAH provided everything but when the humans didn't obeyed ALLAH orders, they payed for their deeds. So from that day every human worked In different forms for his provisions. Some were successful in it and some are still trying hard to meet their both ends. Part time job is one of those different forms of works i. e. doing jobs at a place for few hours and being payed for it, from which billions of people are earning their provisions. Generally, it is done to have that extra cheese or cream in your life, which will make your life more tempting and attractive. But sometimes it is done to meet all the expenses at the end of the month, and in fewer exceptions people do it as a hobby. Turning their spare time in the form of cash. Nothing is perfect in this world so same is the scenario with part time job. It has its good part and worst ones too. Good part is that you have a little bit handsome amount of money in your hands in short time. you are not spending your time like a couch potato. High turnovers, no consistency in quality are few of the ones to be highlited.
