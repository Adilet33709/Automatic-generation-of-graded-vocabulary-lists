When college life starts, students enter in a new phase of life. College life is quite different from school life. Moreover the expenditures are too increased. Some of the parents can not afford the academic expenditures, so, they do not permit their children to get education. But students with good academic records and those who are keep to get educated, they start part time jobs, to fulfil their expenditures along with studies. But, I totally disagree to it. Though on one hand, its useful that in a way students can help out their parents, even though, I disagree with this, because students are the main pillars society. They are the backbone of our progress. So, they should give their full time and potential to studies. If they, start part time jobs, then no doubt, it would be rather more difficult for them to manage both their jobs and studies. In this way they couldn't give their best in any one of them. Infect, they will be tired and frustrated. The timing work will exhaust them and they will fail to cope with their studies. As a result they will be in-efficient and will show worse results in college. The life of a students is the golden time of their life. It is the time, when they have wishes because they are not nature rough. They wanted to plunge onto the starts. So, they should not include in part time jobs. Infect, they should have fours on their goal.
