The trend of part time job is very common in Pakistan as well as in other countries. Specially in European countries because parents cant support their child for their basic needs. It is very common specially in students. The students which are not rich or parents can't spend their money on their studies or parents cant afford them. Part time job mean to do job during studies there were many reasons for part time job. Students do a lot of work to support them self's. In morning they join schools, colleges or universities or at evening they do jobs. Some students do part time jobs just because of fun or some on the basis of their interest but really need it. I think its not necessary for college students and the students who do part time jobs because of their family problems. Parents insist their child to support the family. because their income was not enough to support whole family. And they also studied same time because of burden they lose their health or not able to do one thing properly. But some Child were very talented. They do job or also give proper time to their studies. Their academic record was good. I think if student don't need job then don't do it just focus on their studies with full concentration.
