Part time job has both a positive side and negative side for college students. Part-time jobs can add to the experience for students, but on the other side part-time jobs only add laziness students to gain knowledge in lectures and feared student can not complete the task well. Work part-time foster learning lazy mind, a desire to pursue money, envious, spiteful, selfish and arrogant. Thoughts chase the money is actually very good for the students for future work later when the students will demonstrate his perseverance in working. I think the better part-time work directly supervised by the college or the work is equated with the task of lectures. With the formula so students can feel how hard the atmosphere in employment and foster independence stance while also students also become more cautious in the work, students can also consult directly with the supervisor or lecturer of the course if there is a problem in the job. Part time job that has been set by the college are expected to not disrupt student learning and fostering students' positive thoughts. In general I support the idea of part time work for college students on condition that the job will not lead to failure in their studies.
