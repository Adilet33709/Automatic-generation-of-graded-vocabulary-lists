A college student is transition to adulthood. A college student is different if compare with junior high school or senior high school. At junior high school or senior high school, we didn't thinking about our future. At college student, we have opened our minds to plan for the future. it can do with part-time job. A part-time job is very important for college students. I feel that college students who do part-time jobs can become more confident, independent and responsible. College students who interact and deal with adults learn, through experience, how to behave appropriately in public. Moreover, working for a small sum of money teaches college students the value of hard-earned money. Children who solely depend on their parents for their financial needs quite naturally take the money that they are given for granted. They may also tend to spend their money on useless things. In addition to get the extra money they can prepare their career in future. College students also do part-time job to get some experience for this job. This experience will very useful when they come to real working world, because they can get some experience that will relate to next work. Finally, the transition between the studying and the working worlds is great. Many find it difficult initially to adjust to the working world after schooling. College students who have worked part-time would be more comfortable with the transition.
