In this time, many college students already have a job. Actually it is an part time job. Part time job is different from the ordinary job. Part time job is a Job that have a reduced work time almost half from the normal work time. And the salary it is not as much as salary of the full worker job. The Salary of the Part Time worker is about from Rp100. 000 (one hundred thousand rupiahs) to Rp 1. 000. 000, 00 (one million rupiahs). It can exceed one million rupiah depends on what part time job do you take. I say it was important, because college students can get more experience before he feel the reality world of the bussines world. College Students can feel how hard it takes to make some money, so he become more mature naturally. Part time work can increase students skill ( if the part time job he takes is the same with his Major). It can train a skill of managing time from the student. If he take a part time job, the student must arrange his or her part time schedule with his college schedule. So, it will train the College Student discipline. That's why is think Part time job is important.
