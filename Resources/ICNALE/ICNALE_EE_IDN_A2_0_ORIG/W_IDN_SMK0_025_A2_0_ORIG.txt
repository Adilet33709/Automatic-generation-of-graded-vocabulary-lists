Smoking is a personal right of each person and each person also has the right to not feel the smoke or even the danger and the consequence of smoking. Smoking in public places should not be allowed. The main reason is to make people who not smoking feel uncomfortable, although smoking is basically not good for your health then smoking is prohibited. Many people still smoke in public places, especially in restaurants. The restaurant is a place where people need comfort and nutrition for the body, but when there are people smoking, then comfort is reduced and many potential illnesses who come into the body. A restaurant is not possible to make full rules banning smoking in because they also do not want to lose their potential customers, so it would be nice if every restaurant had a special place for smokers who are already addicted in smoking, so that consumers who do not smoke will not feel disturbed and feel comfortable in restaurants and consumers who are comfortable with smoke billowing smoke in special rooms. but still better if we all do not smoke because the smoke we could not get any advantage, which we can only losses. So it is not easy to decide to ban smoking in a restaurant.
