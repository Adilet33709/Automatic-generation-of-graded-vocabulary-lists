I think the topic interesting enough for detail an explained. In the country especially in Indonesia many differences about agree and disagree completely banned smoking at the restaurants. You know what ? ok, I will explain why there is banned smoking in the restaurants. I have agree with my think. Firstly, I agree with smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because the restaurants room full AC of course this is annoyed somebody who come in the restaurants with bring his family like children and old man. Secondly, smoking in the restaurants annoyed of smell. Commonly in the restaurants there is a different place for smoking are or no smoking area. With there is a stop like that smoker will be comfortable if in the restaurants. Thirdly, smoking in the restaurants not good for healthy. If there are customer were eating in the restaurants and that customers have not good the healthy of course this is a serious problem and quickly to get the solves. If there is a young people man get lungs disease and the kisses of smell a cigarette can added him disease, of course the young man could died. And this very a serious problem. For the reason an explained in above, I think smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country because many not good function for somebody healthy.
