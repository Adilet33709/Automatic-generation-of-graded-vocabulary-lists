We know that smoking is always banned in all of the place actually. Why? Because it has many bad risks for all of the aspects of our life, even though in the restaurant area in this country. And i think it is done properly. I agree with this statement to ban smoking in the restaurant area. Restaurant is one of public facilities which there are so many people who not at all of them is include to smoker. Many people take their child because restaurant is the place which so convert to getter together. So direct or indirect it can influence of comfortability to visitors. We know there are so many effect if we are include to smoker, bad effect surely. First, the most effect is disturbing the breathing, disturbing the lung, and the most scream is cancer of lung, and so on. So this is one of reason, why the smoking is not allowed in restaurant. But i think, this is not only for restaurant as public facility, but also in other public facility, may be at the market, mosque, church, bus stop, railway station another public facility. Some of the solutions is the owner of restaurant provide a special place for smoker, where at that place only for they who have a smoke. But at sometime, this rule is not followed by some people, they feel lazy to go to the box smoke. So, next time, the government has to give a rule about smoke and hard punishment for everyone who disobey the rule.
