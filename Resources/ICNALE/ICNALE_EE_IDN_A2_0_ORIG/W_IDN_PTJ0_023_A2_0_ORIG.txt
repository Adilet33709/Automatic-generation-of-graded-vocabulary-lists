As we know, college student are doing their task in a college what we call it study, almost from them come from outside city. Perhaps they are not coming from rich family they came from a poor family. Some of their parent has profession as a farmer, teacher, fisherman and etc. In fact, is not their obligation to look for money, but this is a kind of demand for their life. They need money for their life. So, there is a kind reason or we can say so much reason for this statement, some people has a part time job is an obligation and some people are not. Sometimes, we found college students has a part time job to complete their needed such as living cost and college administration. And we also found some college students do it for search an experience for their future and better live, and only for fill in their free time or just for having fun. So, in my opinion have a part time job for college students is important. Beside they can help their parent, they can also learn how to manage a time and of course their financial in their life now on.
