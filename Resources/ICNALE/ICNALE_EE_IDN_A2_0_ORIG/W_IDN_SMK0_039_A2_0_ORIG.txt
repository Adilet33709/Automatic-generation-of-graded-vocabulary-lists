I agree with this statement because smoking is a bad habit. As we know, smoking are activities which give no benefits and waste our money. Smoking also make people sick and cause serious diseases, not only for the smokers, but also people who breathe in the smoke of their cigarettes.. Smoking in the restaurant is also not polite because a restaurant is a place for eating. It will harm others. In the world, every year we can find 2, 2 million human death because of lung disease. The disease is coming from smoking habit long years ago. Cigarette have a nicotine. If you think that nicotine is only dangerous cigarette composition, it's wrong! Nicotine can be absorb to the blood. It is make a smoker feel relax because of neurotransmitter. It also make a heart beat, blood pressure and adrenaline feel better. This make a smoker want to smoking again. Cigarette is a material from ignition of tobacco. Almost all that material is danger. This material make lung disease, heart disease, emphysema and the other disease. Some dangerous material in cigarette for example cyanide, benzene, cadmium, , ammonia,, naphthalene, and many others.. In all the restaurant, smoking should be completely banned because it will disturb other person.
