According to me, smoking should be banned at all the restaurant in the country. It do not have any positive effect for the restaurant. It only can disturb the costumer on the restaurant. Many costumer will be the passive smoker. Not only that, The smoke from the cigarette also will poison the food and make people unhealthy. Passive smoker is more dangerous than the active smoker. Passive smoker is a person who indirectly smell the smoke from the cigarette of the active smoker. The smoke is the poison, so the passive smoker is smelling the poison from the cigarette from the active smoker. In many restaurant, there will be so many children. If there is a free smoker in the restaurant, the children will smell the smoke from the cigarette. The food that have been served will automatically poisoned because of the cigarette smoke. So the food will not be healhty again. There is a solution if smoking did not want to be banned from the restaurant. The restaurant must have a smoking area. Smoking area is a place for smoking. It is a closed room and diferrent from the main room, so the smoker can smoking freely in that room.
