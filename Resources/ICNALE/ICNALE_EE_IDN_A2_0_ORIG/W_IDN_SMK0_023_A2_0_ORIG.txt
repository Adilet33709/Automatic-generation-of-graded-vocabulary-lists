I agree, because I am not a smoker, and biologically I am a girl. Smoke is a waste work as I think. May I take you in a little journey to my mind about smoke. Let's imagine that we are a smoker! We bought a cigarette every day to burn it to be ash, actually what we burn it is our money, that is terrible thing, we bought something that's can heard ourselves especially our health. In other case, cigarette is a poison. Everybody knows that, but they cannot leave the cigarette because the poison is in the cigarette itself. If someone smoke it once, he will try again, again and again. He was poisoned with the cigarette, and in the period, cigarette was a primer needed. If we ask to ten mans, eight from them will say; I am a smoker. This is the proof, that cigarette is poisoning almost men in the world. Otherwise, we are as a passive smoker, we must warn them (smoker) for changing their habit in smoke, if they can't leave the cigarette, tell them to understand us as a passive smoker. Such as smoking in a private areas not in a public areas, like a restaurants.
