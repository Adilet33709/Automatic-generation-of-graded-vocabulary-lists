The University students do this to fill their spare time after they finished their study at their University. With taking a part time job they hope they can get salary to fulfill their University needs, for example, copies their paper, searching their homework with go to the Internet center, buy some books to support their reports, join study tour which is a programme from their University to make a thesis, etc. Besides, they get good enough salary from their taking a part time job, to honest, they want to have experiences, challenges, friends, net-working and the last they want to enjoy their young life before they really come into world job. University students who taking a part time job should be wise to set their time between their duty as a University student and their part time job. Actually, it is not easy, but when they take decision to taking a part time job, they already though hardly about the positive sides and the negative sides. They also should have the permission from their parents when they are taking a part time job. Like my friend, she work as private teacher. She works in her spare time. She is good in time management. She enjoys her works, because of that, she turn into an independent woman. It means that a part time job sometime can cause a good effect.
