I agree with the point that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are reasons that part-time job is important. First, it can improve our abilities which cannot be educated in class, like communicating with each other. Second, every company that you want to apply to consider the real job experiences a very important thing. So when interviewing, you will gain advantages over other people by owning a part-time job. And the part time job is really a preparation for one's future professional job. But as a college student, the study of textbook seems very important, and we have all kinds of tests. Doing part-time job may have a negative affection on the score of tests, and may cause very serious things. And if your score are poor, you may even not have the right to graduate from school. And doing part time job my make you see the negative side of our society, eventually causing negative effect on your mind. So, I think it is very important to balance the part-time job with our university life. Getting a high score while doing part-time job is one thing that not everyone can make. So we should give up part time job ant certain time.
