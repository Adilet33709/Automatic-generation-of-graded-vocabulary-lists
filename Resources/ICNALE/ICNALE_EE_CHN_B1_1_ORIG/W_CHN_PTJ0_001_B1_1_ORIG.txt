Now many parents and teachers disagree that college students have their own part-time jobs. Because they are believe that students will spend their study-time on working. But I do not think so, I think a part-time job is one of the most important things in college life. It will be the precious experience in your whole life. Firstly. Part-time job is a good way to fill your spare time after class. Many students spend time on shopping, singing or playing computer games which are pointless. Why do not we take a part-time job to instead of those entertainment ? We can even earn some money from the job by ourselves at least. Secondly. Part-time job can adds your career experience, which is a very useful part in your future life after you graduate. You will learn much knowledge that can not be found in school lessons. Social experience is the biggest chip for graduated students when they interview jobs, it's easier to find jobs for those who have accumulated experiences in part-time jobs. Thirdly. As a matter of fact, a lot of college students from poor families, so taking a part-time job for them is one of the way to afford their college fees. Although the money may be not enough, but that is all they have earned by themselves. From what I have said, it is important to college students to have a part-time job. Study also must be pay attention too, so we should balance the part-time job and study well, after all, the first job of students is study.
