I totally approve of this point. Being current college students, we should take an active part in the part-time job, if we accomplish our study task first. With the constant development of economy and society, everyone including students are faced with great challenges. Many students who graduate from university cannot find a satisfying job. They also suffer great pressure. Doing a part-time job can benefit students who will come into the society to some extent. First of all, students can improve their other abilities through the experience. Moreover, they can realize the society in depth. Besides, students are informed of the fact that the society isn't favorable to everyone. Those who long for a great success and a bright career must exert themselves to study hard. In this sense, students are alerted through the part-time job. Take me for example; I once acted as a waitress in a small hotel. During the period, I had to serve customers and take their orders. I served dishes and rice for them. And I was rather tired within these days. Though the pays was low, I was excited. I learned that everyone should spare no efforts to do something if they hunger for a better life in the society. I will enforce myself to study hard. All in all, there is point for college students to do a part-time job during the time in university.
