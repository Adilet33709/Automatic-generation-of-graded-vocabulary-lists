I somewhat disagree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. As is well known, smoking is a killer of humans'health, which does great harm to our breath systems and finally makes our bodies weak. And what makes matters worse; most healthy people dislike the smell of smoking, which is not only the matter the citizens care about but also the matter that affects the whole impression of the place. So we could safely come to the conclusion that smoking is harmful to everyone eager for health and honor except for the factories making out the cigars and alike. However, even though smoking is hateful, we'd better say that we should try to control it not to ban it, or we would be subjective. For one thing, part of people here couldn't give it up right away for smoking is the comfort in their lives. It's obvious that if one could live longer without emotion and happiness, he might prefer to choose a shorter life with happiness. So we shouldn't kill people's happiness at the moment except when we find something else to replace it and they are willing to accept. For another, restaurants are the places where the citizens experience life and relax themselves. Many are accustomed to smoke there. As we see, having a smoke in an ordinary restaurant is like a function of the restaurant itself. From the above, we could get to know that smoking could not be completely banned in the restaurants in the country. However, we might find other ways to improve the environment we live in. For example, there could be restaurants and other public places alike especially for smoking, where you could smoke as you like without any limitation.
