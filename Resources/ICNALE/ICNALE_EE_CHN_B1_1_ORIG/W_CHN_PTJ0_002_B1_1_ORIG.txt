In my opinion, I am strongly agree with the idea that, it is important for our college students to have a part-time job. Now we can see everywhere that student take part –jobs like private teacher, seller and so on. So why they do these jobs? What advantages benefit us? I think the main reason is money. With the improvement of our living standards, a lot of study material are expensive than before. Then the student has to do some jobs to reduce considerable financial pressure. By doing so, we can also have the ability to travel or buy some items we like. We also hope that through this way, we can no longer dependent on our parents. In addition, we can also accumulate some social experience. From kindergarten to high school, what we learned is totally the knowledge from books. In this way, it does a lot benefits to our future jobs. In a word, there are many advantages for our college students to do some jobs. Not only make money, but also develop our independence. So if you a lot of free time after class, try to look for a part-time job and you will not regret about it.
