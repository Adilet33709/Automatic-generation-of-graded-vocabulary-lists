It is a hot topic for college students to argue whether it is important to have a part-time job. Different people have different view. Some students advocate the idea. For one reason as result, college students should responsible for ourselves, and part-time job can provide us the opportunity to make money, so that we can not to ask parents for our allowances. And it can also relief the pressure of parents. For another, through part-time job we can gain a lot of experience. Besides, it will good for us to prepare our future job. As the competition is fiercer in the social life, the more experience you have, the more chance you will have. However, the others are against the idea, they hold that as a student, we should focus our attention on study. It will spend much of our time and energy to do the part-time job. Because as part-time worker, our life and property security is not well protected by the law. For my own perspective, as we enter the university we have more free time, it is important for you to choose how to use of them. We should make the most of time and be the master of it. From my own experience, I am working in the restaurant in my free time, and I feel happy to have the job.
