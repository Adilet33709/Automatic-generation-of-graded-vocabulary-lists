There are no complete agreements among the students about the view about whether we should take part-time job. Many students hold the opinion that we should have part-time jobs. However, also there are a lot of them having a different view. The people who hold the first view think it is helpful and wise to take part-time jobs. Firstly, they think they can develop their experience and capacities during working. It is obvious that this can make preparations for the job in the future. Second, they can get money on their own, cultivating their independence and skill. Finally, they can contract a lot of people and learn from them what cannot be taught in the school. But the people who take the second view don't think so, they think it's not suit for students to do part-time jobs. Students' primary task is to study, without being worsted in the knowledge which they should gain in the school; they may lose the opportunity of finding a better job after graduation. So it is not right for them to spend their energy and time on part-time job. Weighing the two kinds of views, I think it is beneficial for us to try part-time jobs but not putting all the time and energy on it.
