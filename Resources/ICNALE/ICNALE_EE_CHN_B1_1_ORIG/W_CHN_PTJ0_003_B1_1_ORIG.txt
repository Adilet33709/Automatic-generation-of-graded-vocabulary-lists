As we all know, some college students have part-time jobs to support their life in college, and other students spend their parents' money to live their life. Many times it's hard for us to say who is right or who is wrong. But in social opinion, also in my opinion, it is important for college students to have part-time jobs. Firstly, having part-time jobs to support college students' life in college can reduce their parents' financial burden. Our parents are no longer giving money to us or give less money to us. It can save the whole family's expenses. Secondly, having part-time jobs can develop our ability. If we have a part-time job, we will know the society or interpersonal relationship better, and we may make friends with more people. It's useful for our future work. In other words we can prepare for our future. In a word, working opens our eyes. Finally, using the money that earned by ourselves, will make us feel great. We all know that food made by ourselves tastes more delicious, the house built by ourselves live more comfortable. As the same way, the money earned by ourselves spends more fulfilling. No matter you live in a poor family or rich family or well-off family, having part-time jobs can help you in many ways. So it is important for college students to have part-time jobs.
