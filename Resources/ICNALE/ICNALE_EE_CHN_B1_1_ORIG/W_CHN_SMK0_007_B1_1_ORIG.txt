Nowadays, there still exist many uncivilized behaviors in the public such as smoking, spitting, littering. Especially, I believe that smoking recklessly in the public both does harm to the health of people and to the environment. So, I support the initiative that smoking should be completely banned in the public. The following reasons can be figured out to support the argument. Undoubtedly, banning of public smoking is not only beneficial to others but also to the smoker's health. If smoking is banned, smokers may smoke less, there are less second hand smoking released into the air, so people have less chance to be exposed to the polluted air. Furthermore, no smoking environment will bring us fresh air and good mood. This will obviously promote cultural and ideological progress by forbidding bad manners and developing good ones. In addition, it is a reminder that we should improve our awareness of caring others. Since it is not only beneficial to the smokers themselves but also to the society, why not take it?All mentioned above tell us the advantages of the banning. It is time to take the advice of banning and to put special emphasis on the improvement public environment though it is a litter harsh to the smokers.
