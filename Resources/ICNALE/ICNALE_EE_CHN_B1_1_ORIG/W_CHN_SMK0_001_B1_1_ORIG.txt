As we know, smoking is not only harmful to people's health but also to the environment. Smoking can deal to many diseases, such as the cancer of lung and so on. So it is very important and necessary to stop people from smoking in public place, especially in all restaurants. There is 3 reasons for that. The first one is, restaurants are the public places that people have meals, so keep the air clean is a duty of everyone. Smoking can generate dirty smoke to pollution the surrounding air. There are a lot of harmful substances in the smoke, it is no doubt the harmful substances will sticky on food and then they will be eaten by people. So you can imagine how unhealthy the food. I think no people will like this environment when eating. Secondly. What more serious is, the people sit around the smokers have to breath the second-handed smoke, that more harmful to their health than the smokers'. Smoking affects non-smokers more than it does smokers. Ratio of passive smokers getting ill is higher than that of smokers. So smokers should think more about the other people, should not build their habit over others' health. All in all, I am agreed with the government ban smoking completely at all restaurants in the country.
