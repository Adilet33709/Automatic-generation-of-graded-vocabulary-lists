One the whole, I don't think it should be banned through the legal system. It should be a choice of the restaurant owner. Then I would foresee that most restaurants would go non smoking but at least a few would still keep ashtrays on the tables. But what if I am a restaurant owner, especially when I am a school restaurant manager? You know, all the restaurants in Wuhan University do not give permission for people to smoke. But I still see somebody smoking. I would ban the smoking strictly. Now I will give you my reason. A person like me who does not smoke also have a right not to smoke, I mean, second hand smoke. Second hand smoke causes many of the same diseases as direct smoking including lung cancer and respiratory diseases. The famous website Wikipedia list several million words about the bad effect of passive smoking. And according to some experts, the cause of passive smoking is even worse than first hand smoking. What's worse, the smoke causes horrible effect to pregnant woman and little baby. So, considering about our country's future, I am strongly against smoke. Restaurants are places for eating; a satisfaction of your appetite, so at least in some degree eating can substitute with each other. So it is easier to forget smoking, especially for those smoking addicts. So smoking should be banned in restaurants, especially in those school restaurants.
