Nowadays, more and more college students think it is of great value and necessity to get a part-time job. For me, I am also one of them. I fully agree with that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. The reasons are as follows. Firstly, gaining a part-time job is not only for the purpose of earning much money. What values more is the experience you get to promote your capacity such as communication, independence, your solution to an issue, and so on. That is to say, you can do things on your own if you gain some experience from part-time job. Secondly, it is a good opportunity to be involved in the society, forming a foundation for your future work. We are students but we are adults now. Therefore, the campus is not the only place we should stay. Outside school, you will see more interesting things. However, what I want to say is that a job will certainly take much of your spare time that your may feel stressed. So you should learn to schedule your time before working. In that way, I believe you can balance your time and lead a colorful college life.
