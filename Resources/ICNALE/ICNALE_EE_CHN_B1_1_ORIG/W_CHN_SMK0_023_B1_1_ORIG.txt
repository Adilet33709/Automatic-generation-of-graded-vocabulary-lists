I am partly for the perspective that all the restaurants in the country should prohibit from smoking. As you know, restaurant is the place where people have their meals. What the most important for the restaurant it to keep the environment clean and the dishes tidy. If the guests smoke, he or she will probably pollute the surroundings. Worse still, they might drop the smoke ask on the table or the dishes. Accordingly, it is necessary for every restaurant to prevent from smoking. Only in this way can we have a better circumstance for our dinners in the restaurant. However, there are possibly some bad effects on this action. On one hand, smoking is the sign of man. The relationship between smoking and man is as important as that between making-up and woman. Thus, man at the restaurant especially during the time of having dinner seems to be superior to others. They may feel that this is the representative of their social status. On the other hand, people like businessman sometimes smoke at the restaurant in order to cope with some difficulties and promote the negotiation smoothly. All in all, I partly agree with the point of view of banning smoking totally at all the restaurants in our country.
