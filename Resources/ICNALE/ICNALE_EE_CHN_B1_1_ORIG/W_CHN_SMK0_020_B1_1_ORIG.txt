The argument whether smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country is discussed hotly. I will show the different opinions below. Those who are in favor of the idea claim that we all know that cigarette contains many harmful materials that can cause lung cancer or other incurable diseases, it is very harm to smoke. On the one hand, it will waste a lot of money for smokers to buy cigarette. On the other hand, smoking is harmful to both the smoker and the people who smell it. And there also have many examples who suffered disease owing to smoke too much. So for the benefit of smoker themselves and other people, it is a wide choice to ban smoking in the restaurant. Those who are opposed to the banned hold that smoking is personal habit just like some people like reading and running, others have no right to interfere. Besides, restaurant is a place for people to eat meal and relax. So smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants. As far as I am concerned, my favor goes to the former opinion. If the policy goes well, we can enjoy our meal in a healthy environment.
