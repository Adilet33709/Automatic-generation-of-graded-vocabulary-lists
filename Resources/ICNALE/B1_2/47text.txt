Smoking is a very harmful activity. People who can smoke cannot live a healthy life because it is harmful for the person who smokes, and it has a bad effect on the people in their surroundings. Smoking should be banned in all public places, but here we discuss that it should be banned in restaurants. People go to restaurants with their families to enjoy a meal, or when visiting an area, or some other purpose. They become irritated because of smoking. Some people, who are allergic,  start coughing because of smokers. They do not enjoy their meal or the purpose for which they came, and some even start vomiting. Smoking should be banned in restaurants because it affects the whole environment of the restaurant. The smoke from cigarettes and shisha and some other harmful types of smoking such as marijuana affects both the user and the people present in their surroundings. Sometimes, it also causes lung cancer; 80% of the cases of lung cancer are caused by smoking. From the above arguments, it is clear that smoking should be banned in restaurants. By doing so, we can save the lives of both the smokers and non-smokers, and we can clean our environment.
