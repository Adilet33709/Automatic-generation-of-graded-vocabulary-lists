Since we were born until we graduated from high school, our parents have supported our financial needs. Even while attending college, we still use our parents' money. But not all students rely on their parents. Some work part-time teaching elementary, junior high, or senior high school students. Working part-time does not mean you have to be a teacher; there are many other jobs. We can look for them on the Internet or ask for help at the CAC (Career Assistance Center at our university). Or, we can ask for recommendations from friend who already have a part-time job. Working part time doesn't mean we have to work while we are studying. We can work part time during the holidays, so we don't waste our time lazing around not knowing what to do. By working part time, we can get some activity to do, and we can get money to lessen the burden on our parents. Working part time also gives us experience. However, later, when we are looking for a job to fulfill our needs, we can write our part-time job on our CV. So, it's important for us as college students to have a part-time job. Although, we can't fulfill all of our needs, we can learn to be independent.
