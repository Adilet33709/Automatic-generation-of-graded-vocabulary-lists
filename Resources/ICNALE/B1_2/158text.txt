Smoking is addictive, but I am rarely around people who smoke because I think smoking affects other people. I often read news reports about how many people in Taiwan suffer from illness or even death because of smoking, and the adverse effects of second-hand smoke are far more than people imagine, but the government has no way of establishing clear and effective laws and regulations. After all, this is a personal habit so a law cannot be implemented. So I think school education is important in letting people know that smoking is a bad habit. In addition to other personal health problems, smoking has very bad effects on the environment. When I see a smoker on the road, they do not take away their cigarette butts, but they readily throw them in the street. I think this is not very good. This habit causes an environmental mess and destroys the beauty of the road. So I hope people can think about whether smoking can be good for you. If the answer is no, then please stop this behavior, and persuade smokers around you to stop. Life without smoking is more beautiful.
