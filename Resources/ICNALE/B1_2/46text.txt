I agree with this statement. Now I am in the third year of university. When I entered the university, I had to have a part-time job because I needed money. If I do not work, I cannot have fun in my college life. For example, drinking, travelling, buying clothes would be impossible. If you want to enjoy your college life, money is really one of the essential things. That is why it is very important for college students to have a part- time job. By the way, I am sure that you can gain and learn a lot of things if you have a part-time job. In a part-time job, you can meet lots of kinds of people, for example other university students and regular workers. By communicating with such kinds of people, you can learn and be stimulated by them and possibly make friends with them. You can also experience the first stage of social work. When you are in third year, you usually go job hunting. If you work at a part-time job, you can talk with regular workers and see the real work place and also notice the difficulty of working there. For that reason, experiencing a part-time job can help you job hunt. That is why I strongly believe that it is really important for college students to have a part-time job.
