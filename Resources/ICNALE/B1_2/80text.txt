Smoking has many disadvantages. Smoking jeopardizes people's health, causes people to have unpleasant appearances, and even more serious, harms the relationships between family members. Moreover, restaurants are public areas for different kinds of people to enter. Therefore, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants for the sake of the mental and physical health of the public. First, smoking is an activity that endangers people's health because the major components in the cigarette are tar and nicotine, which are harmful to the human body. At the same time, people who do not smoke absorb the secondhand smoke from the smokers while they are having meals in the restaurant. The results of inhaling the secondhand smoke are as serious as smoking, and the chemicals inside the cigarette can cause many diseases such as heart disease, high blood pressure, and cancer. The consequences of those diseases can be fatal. Therefore, smoking should not be allowed in restaurants in order to prevent fatal diseases. Furthermore, restaurants are public places that everyone can enter. If secondhand smoke is present inside the restaurant, all of the people inside the restaurant are forced to inhale the harmful smoke, thus putting people’s health in danger. Therefore, smokers should not be so selfish as to smoke inside restaurants. To sum up, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants for the sake of the health of the public.
