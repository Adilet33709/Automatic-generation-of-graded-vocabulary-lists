I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First, smoking is not good for our health. Smoke is made up of various toxic chemical ingredients and is a cause of disease, as well as not being good for health. Also, smoking is especially not good for the lungs. So, it becomes hard to breathe during activities like exercise or singing. Next, non-smoking people in restaurants would become targets of second-hand smoke if we allow smoking in restaurants. I heard that second-hand smoke is more harmful than smoking first-hand. Maybe, there are weak persons such as children, pregnant women, or the elderly in the restaurant. These weaker people never want to breathe second-hand smoke because it is very harmful for them. These days, almost all cafeterias are divided into two places, one for smoking and one for non-smokers. I think dividing space into two places is one good solution but it is hard to have a perfect effect. Therefore, I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, or if there are smoking rooms outside the restaurants.
