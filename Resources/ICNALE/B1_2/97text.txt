I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Certainly, many people who don't smoke don't want to eat next to smokers. I agree with this thinking. But by banning smoking at a restaurant, smokers won’t go there to eat and drink. Banning smoking has two bad effects. First, when smoking is banned at all the restaurants, smokers cannot eat out. Then they can't eat something in their favorite restaurants. It makes them unhappy. And when smokers don't eat in restaurants, the number of guests who comes to restaurants will be less than ever. Then the profit of the restaurant will decrease. I think that this is very inconvenient for the restaurant, so I disagree that smoking should be completely banned. But we should consider people who don't smoke. Therefore, I think that smoking should be partially banned at all the restaurants. Restaurants should have some space where people can smoke and some space where people can not smoke. By doing that, both of non-smokers and smokers can enjoy their meals. So I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, but I agree that it should be partially banned.
