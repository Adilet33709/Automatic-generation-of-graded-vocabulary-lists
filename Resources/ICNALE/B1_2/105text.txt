I am a university student, and when I have free time, I go to my part-time job. The reason why I go to this part-time job is that I want to add to my experiences and earn more money for my daily life. Before I was a university student, some bosses may have thought I was too young to do some part-time jobs, so it was difficult to find a part-time job. The special experience in my part-time job was to teach children aged only five years' old. At first, I thought it was a difficult job, but when I realized how to face children, I was so happy that I could do this job, it gives me so many experiences and I love children more than before. A part-time job is a good way to kill time and make some new friends. Therefore, I suggest that all college students find a suitable job in their free time; however, they cannot forget their school studies. They must be careful not to be cheated because they want to make money, so they should find the healthiest way to find a happy part-time job to enrich their lives.
