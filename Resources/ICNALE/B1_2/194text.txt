I think it is a good regulation that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Of course, there are pros and cons for smoking. However, only one advantage comes to mind. People who smoke will trigger a chemical reaction in their brain which makes them feel good, happy, and comfortable, but they will have to get more cigarettes to achieve the same level of happiness. Thus, the first disadvantage is that people will gradually spend more money on smoking. Second, the most serious problem resulting from smoking is the damage to health. Smoking destroys people's lungs. Smokers can't breathe as well as non-smokers, so they can't be good athletes. Health issues may influence their life quality, too. Besides, smoking increases the risk of suffering from cancer. What's worse, smoking has a great impact on both the smokers themselves and the people around those smokers. That's the main reason I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. When someone smokes in a restaurant, it not only influences others at that time but also people who come in the future. Because the furniture and walls may absorb the bad things coming from the cigarettes, and impact future customers. Thus, I think smoking ought to be prohibited at all the restaurants in the country.
