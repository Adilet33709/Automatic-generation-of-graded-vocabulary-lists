In recent months, the government has been trying to introduce a new law to ban smoking in all restaurants. From my point of view, banning smoking in all restaurants is necessary. First, I think it is essential to protect the citizens’ health. It is well known that cigarettes are carcinogenic and can induce many health problems, and the harmful substances are easily spread by the smoke. If one person smokes in a restaurant, all the other customers and the waiters will inhale the harmful smoke. Some people suggest building smoking rooms. However, the waiters still have to enter the room to serve the customers. Therefore, it is necessary to ban smoking in all restaurants to prevent harming the citizens. Second, banning smoking can prevent arguments about the definition of “indoors” from occurring. Many arguments about this keep appearing. I think it is very difficult to define whether a restaurant is “indoors” or not because different restaurants have their own design. I strongly believe that this problem will never be solved unless a new law is established. For the above reasons, I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants.
