Today, human beings have more things to get addicted to. Some things are good and others are bad, but bad things are also attractive by peer pressure, such as alcohol, weed, cigarettes, etc. The easiest thing that you can take any place and any time that comforts you is a cigarette. When you walk on the street, you can find a person who is smoking along the way. You would see at least one person because smoking is not prohibited. I will give you an example of a place that has smoking: restaurants, places that have every generation of human come in it. Actually, people who come to these places come in with family on holidays. What do you think when your family comes to a restaurant and finds that this restaurant allows smoking. Is this still a holiday? Smoking is killing your mood when eating and talking with your family. However, this is not as important as that it kills your family when they breathe smoke. In my opinion, the government must approve the laws that prohibit smoking in public. It could be best if the first places that the laws concern are restaurants, parks, and universities.
