I disagree that having a part-time job is important for a college student. The average Singaporean college student will be bombarded with a huge amount of work. Where in the world would a student find the time to take up a part-time job? It requires a lot of time and effort for such a commitment. A college student without much skill would be left to do manual labor and paid low wages. Time is very precious to a college student (in contrast to a secondary school student), and the amount of time and effort is simply not worth a few bucks per hour. However, should the student have spare time on his or her hands, it would be good to get a part-time job. Having a part time job allows the student to get a taste of the working world and it could be useful in the future when applying for a job. Also, additional income wouldn't hurt anyone. A part-time job would be more suitable if it's during school vacation. Having a job during the school term might cause students to burn out. They might go to class feeling tired or have less concentration, affecting their studies. It's more important to focus on studies so that we are able to carve out our own careers in the future.
