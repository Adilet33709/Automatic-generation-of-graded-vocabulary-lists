There are three reasons why I agree that college students should have a part-time job. First of all, they will learn how to manage their money effectively. When working part time, they will get more money and they can reduce their parent's burden by helping to pay their school fees. It is not only money that the student must be able to manage effectively. The student will learn how to manage their time too. They will learn how to divide their time between work and study. This way, they will become an expert in time management if they can balance their part-time work with their studies. Also, their time won't be wasted doing activities that aren't important or are unproductive. And finally, the students will get more friends outside of the university. It can be hard to meet people when at university or at least in a different crowd of people. But if you work outside the university, you will meet lots of new people; making new friends can be refreshing when university becomes a bit stale and suffocating. Some people may disagree with me, but I believe there are more benefits than drawbacks for people who work part-time while studying.
