I agree with this statement. I think smoking should be banned at all restaurants. I have 2 reasons. Firstly, because of the bad smell, people cannot enjoy eating at restaurants. Recently, in most restaurants, smoking and non-smoking areas are divided, but it is impossible to shut out the smoke and bad smell completely. So some people who don't smoke have to endure the bad smell from the smoking area while eating. Because of the smell of smoke, sometimes the smell or taste of food is changed. In order to keep the quality of food and people's rights to enjoy eating, smoking should be banned at all restaurants. Secondly, smoke is bad for our health. It causes many kinds of disease, like lung cancer. For smokers it is totally voluntary to take this risk, but non-smokers also have to breathe in smoke at restaurants for the reasons stated above. Moreover, secondhand smoke includes more dangerous substances than firsthand smoke. Especially in restaurants, people often take their babies and children, and smoke has really bad effect for their physical development. We need protect people around smokers from smoke in public spaces. Therefore, I think smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan.
