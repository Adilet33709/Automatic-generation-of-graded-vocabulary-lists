I agree with banning smoking at all restaurants. Youths are at risk of smoking addictions and the risks tend to be much higher each year. When they smoke cigarettes, they then stick to it until they die. It is not easy to quit, so young people should learn and realize the danger of smoking and help to solve the problem by themselves by maybe beginning to learn before, such as about the harm of smoking. Maybe they can learn from books, media, the Internet, or asking teachers as well as those who have knowledge of using leisure time usefully. Probably like playing sports like football, table tennis, or a running style that would generate such a beneficial use of leisure time and still have good health and also relaxing results. Without having to rely on cigarettes, they can play music, sing, dance, and play Extra, which have the benefit of using free time then. Also, the practice of musical expression can also train the heart. The challenge of arts and crafts activities such as drawing, sculpting, or using hundreds of beads is like meditation and you create value by yourself. In addition, young people know problems rationally with no tobacco dependence. They know their roles and responsibilities with the intention of fighting fees. They obey the teachings of parents and business teachers and behavior, but do good. The cheerful spirit of challenge with the principles of religion is a way of Florida life. Apart from self-help, we can also help friends and others in society with a joint campaign to reduce smoking and help quitting.
