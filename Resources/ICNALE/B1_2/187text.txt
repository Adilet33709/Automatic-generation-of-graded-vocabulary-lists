I disagree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Certainly, smoking is bad for one’s health. There is scientific evidence and everyone knows this fact. Above all, non-smokers dislike smoking. Though I do not smoke, we have a choice whether we smoke or not. We have a right to do things freely. Many smokers may relieve stress by smoking. I would feel sorry for them if smoking was banned, because they would lose their way to relieve stress. Smoking is banned in public. Now, in Japan some restaurants have smoking seats and non-smoking seats, and others have only non-smoking seats. If smoking is banned more, people will smoke only their houses. Non-smoking areas are increased this way. But, recently cigarettes have been sold not only at tobacconists but also at convenience stores. In fact, tax on cigarettes helps the Japanese government. Nevertheless, banning smoking in many places is a mistake. It is not only smokers who are bad. The Japanese government has the responsibility to solve a problem. Though it is a very difficult issue, it is not natural that only smokers are blamed. Also, non-smokers have to try to be patient and understand smokers, and smokers have to be careful about their manners when they smoke.
