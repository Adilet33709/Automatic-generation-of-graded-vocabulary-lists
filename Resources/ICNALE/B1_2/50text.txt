I agree that it is important for college students have a part-time job, even though I have never worked at a part-time job. Nowadays, most college students have to spend a huge amount on registration fees to study at university. The price of registration fees is approaching almost 400-500. However, they don't have any ability to pay these fees, so their parents have to shoulder the entire cost instead of them. If students work at part-time jobs, they would lighten their parents' burden. I think it is also one of the ways to help one's parents. The other reason why I agree with it is that it can help to gain a lot of experience for students' careers. For employment, many companies demand lots of careers of students. It would be good experience to have part-time jobs. Also, students who work part-time jobs can learn how to treat people and to interact socially. In addition, they can develop personality traits like diligence, manners, common sense, and partnership. That's why it is important for college students have a part-time job. Some people worry about that it disturbs students' study, but students with part-time jobs have to manage their time and energy themselves.
