It is necessary for college students to have a part-time job. The major purpose of college is education, thus, the college must provide a safe environment and a peaceful learning place. Because of the safe environment at school, students are always protected from the ruthless social reality of work, so they cannot observe the differences between the workplace and the educational place. Students can gain skills which are important in the workplace, such as work attitude, and they can increase their patience in order to deal with problems. Additionally, they will understand how to find out the relation between the part-time job and the knowledge they learned in college. Most of all, a part-time job for college students can make them actively get friends and expand their viewpoints, so they will not set their target too small and narrow in the future. Of all the effects of a part-time job, I think the most important and deepest one is about work attitude and patience. Even if someone is smart or learned, he or she will easily be in trouble if he or she lacks one of the above. Frankly speaking, learning how to get along with people will always be important and more difficult than the learning of knowledge. We can compare the workplace with a new college that proffers the learning of human relations. From a part-time job, we can learn more skills about how to live well in the workplace.
