I worked part-time as a tutor after finishing national service. At first, I had trouble getting back into the hang of academic subjects, as I had basically spent two years in my camouflage uniform looking at guns all day. I also felt a little frustrated, as I had already mastered the two subjects, Mathematics and Chemistry, back in my junior college years. I could not understand why all my knowledge had basically disappeared in the short span of two years. So, in addition to getting monetary income, I had another reason to pick up my lost skills again, as I had to prove to myself that I did have the concepts contained in those two subjects within my reach. In addition, I had the chance to reinforce those concepts in the process of teaching my student verbally because I was rehearsing my knowledge of the subject matter and solidifying my grasp on said concepts. Altogether, I had a very enriching experience being a private tutor, as I loved learning and academia in general. In the process, I developed important interpersonal communication skills, for example by being articulate and patient. Of course, having a stable source of income did not hurt either.
