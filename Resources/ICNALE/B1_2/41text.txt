I agree because part-time jobs make you expend your free time in the right way. Somebody kills time by going shopping or traveling and all activities lose time but if you get a job in a shop or restaurant earning your own money. Second, it can improve your skills if you only have a small social circle and can accommodate so the job would help you to meet new many kinds of people and this might be good for you. Third it improves patience and can make you grow up. The job might be hard sometimes or not comfortable; but if you can do it that would be great. Fourth, you are in college, which means you are not a little child. A part-time job can help your parents and you would be proud of yourself that you can earn your own pocket money by your own two hands. In other words, your mother would not reprove you any more about your new shirt or new shoes. The last reason some learners do not have much time to exercise so a job would help you move your body and use your brain, which results is good health. I think it is a good way to spend your time is with a past-time job and don't forget to study hard, too.
