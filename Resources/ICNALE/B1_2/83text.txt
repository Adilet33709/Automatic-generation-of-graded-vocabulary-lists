Personally, I feel that it is good for students to have part-time jobs, especially when they are studying in a polytechnic or university where the students have long breaks. Polytech students like me have many breaks in a year. For example, we have six weeks around August to go out to work and earn money to buy our textbooks and pay our expenses. This way, we do not have to rely on our parents to give us all our pocket money. Having this part-time job can also allow us to learn how to be independent and understand the difficulty of earning money so that we will not squander our parents' money away by spending on things that are not necessary. By having a part-time job, students are also able to learn social skills and how to interact with other people and try out different kinds of jobs until finding one that is suitable. We can also learn what our strengths are and what field we could work in when we graduate from our tertiary education. Therefore, overall, I agree that students should have a part-time job. Even a less time-consuming part-time job would suffice.
