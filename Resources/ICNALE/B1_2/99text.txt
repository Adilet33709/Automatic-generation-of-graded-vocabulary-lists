As we know, smoking is bad for our health. But, there are still many people who smoke. Once they begin smoking, they can rarely can stop because they become addicted to it. When we are addicted to something, it's hard to get over it. People who don't smoke can also get the effects of the smoke as passive smokers. Passive smokers inhale cigarette smoke even though they don't smoke. One effect of being a passive smoker is lung cancer. So, to protect other non-smoking people, the government sets a rule that prohibits smokers from smoking in public spaces, such as at malls and universities. According to the rule, malls and other public spaces have to provide some places where the smoker can smoke. At restaurants, there are places that are assigned as smoking areas. Although the area is separated, the smoke can still affect people who don't smoke. This is because there is no glass separating the smoking area from the no smoking area, so we can still inhale the smoke. Let's look at an example, when the restaurant is full and the waitress places someone who smokes near our table, it will annoy us because of the smoke. So, I think it's better for restaurants to not allow smoking in restaurants.
