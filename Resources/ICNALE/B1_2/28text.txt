With increasing tuition fees for college and university, some parents cannot send their children to college. Having a part-time job depends on the status of the person. If one belongs to a high status family, ones parents can send them to great schools. If one belongs to a low status family, ones parents cannot send them to good schools. Some parents will do anything just to send their children to school. Some borrow money and some pay the tuition fees even if they do not have enough money to cover other needs. In this regard, some students just stop studying and work so that they can help-out their family financially. Having a part-time job is an option for some students who are having a hard time with their family, to help them meet their needs. It is a good option for college students to have a part-time job because they can earn money to help their family financially while also getting an education to have a good career in the future. It is also hard to be in this situation; it is hard for some students to balance their studies while having a job. Students should really do their best in their studies while also doing their job so that their education and time at work will be of great value.
