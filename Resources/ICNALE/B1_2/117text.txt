I agree this statement that it is important for college students to have a part time job. I think the best way to learn about money and society is to have a part-time job. In having a part-time job, college students learn about money and society and understand how difficult it is to earn money. College students also learn about  society which is not in school. More and more college students have a part-time job, they are able to prepare for their future life when they will work for their families. If college students don't have a part-time job and don't know what life is, they will have great difficulty in working. During college years, managers don't blame college students heavily if they make a mistake. But in a company, managers blame them heavily. To get used to work and earn money, college students need to have a part-time job. College students need to have a part-time job to know what a life is. So I agree with this statement that it is important for college students to have a part time job.
