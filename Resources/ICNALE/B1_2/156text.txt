Despite the fact that the media tells us that science has proven that smoking kills, makes us ugly, and makes us less appealing, many people still continue lighting up cigarettes. However, what exactly has science proven? Scientists have not successfully proven that smoking leads to cancer, or that cancer will kill us, therefore, they have not proven that smoking will kill us. It has only been a hypothesis, and we fail to understand that statistics do not indicate the truth of scientific theories. Consider the hypothesis: 80% of people who eat broccoli die of cancer. It seems very intuitive to say that broccoli causes cancer, which we can acknowledge is a very absurd claim. What we fail to consider upon first glance is that the number of people who eat broccoli is very high, and this large group of people get cancer as much any other groups of people due to all sorts of factors, such as genetics. It seems that practically anything around us can give us a disease and kill us, including our cellphones or the hand driers in public toilets. So, if smoking is what you enjoy, light up.
