Part-time jobs are not a person's priority job; they are jobs that take up less time than a full time job. Some people who take part-time jobs are in need of money, but some take them because they want to give back to society. This is a more common thing for students who cannot afford materials for school. It is also common for young adults who are raising a family and are in need of greater income. For adults, it may be much easier to handle having a part-time job, but for working students it may be much harder. In my own experience, I sleep late to finish my projects, but for working students it is more challenging; they have to balance their time well. Many people take part-time jobs just to earn money or to earn more than they already are, but there are those who take part-time jobs because they want to give back to society. An example of these people may be college professors who already have a profession. An example of this may be an architect. Yes, some of them have a lot of projects and earn a lot of money, but they still choose to teach, not just to earn money but because they love architecture and are passionate about it.
