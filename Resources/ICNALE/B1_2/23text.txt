In my opinion, smoking should be banned in all restaurants in Singapore. The reason is that I feel smoking harms society by causing multiple diseases and posing health risks to both the smoker and the people inhaling secondhand smoke. By banning smoking, we can cut down on health care costs because fewer people will fall ill from the smoke, which means there would be less strain on the national healthcare system. Banning smoking also allows all diners to eat in peace, and so that their appetites are not ruined from inhaling poisonous smoke while they are eating. In my view, I think that smoking is not a bad thing in itself, as long as smokers know the risks to their health and they choose to do it. The key thing that they should take note of is that the smoke can possibly harm all the people that inhale the smoke, including family siting close by. Therefore, by banning smoking, the law will actually help to protect family members from health risks. In conclusion, I feel that smoking should be banned, simply because it is reasonable to not want to inhale secondhand smoke, and as a non-smoker, we should have the right and privilege to not inhale smoke. I value my health highly and do not wish to compromise it.
