I strongly support the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, not only because I hate the smell of tobacco, but also because it is bad for the health of all the people in a restaurant. I have 3 reasons mainly. Firstly, because tobacco smoke smells so bad for non-smokers, it is very irritating to endure it. Even though some restaurants have the smoking seats, smoke comes into the non-smoking area and disturb us when we are trying to enjoy the food. I always get a headache when I smell tobacco smoke, and I feel like leaving soon, even when the food is delicious. As long as smoking causes harm to others in public spaces, it should not be allowed at all. The next reason is the cost of restaurants. Because there are a lot of people who hate the smoking, restaurants have to separate the area to get customers. However, as I mentioned before, it is very difficult to separate completely and cost too much if they use high-tech solutions like air curtains. It is much better to prohibit smoking itself in all restaurants because it can be fairer with no difference between restaurants. Lastly, even for smokers, smoking in restaurants should be banned. That is because smokers cannot stop smoking by themselves but it is sure they should reduce their tobacco intake for their own health. Actually, restaurants or coffee shops are the best place for them to smoke in their daily life. If smoking is banned, surely they have to endure their cravings until they come home or they find smoking space in a station or some other space. Therefore, it can be of benefit even to smokers in a long term aspect. For these reasons, I think we should ban smoking completely at all restaurants.
