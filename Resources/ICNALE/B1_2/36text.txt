veryone wants to have a good healthy life without any diseases. One way to keep from having a miserable life is to know what is good and bad for your body, and do not do what is harmful for you. Many people smoke knowing that it can damage their body pretty easily. However, those same people want to have a life with no pain. Those people do not deserve a right to think about an existence without agony. I think it is really absurd. God gave us a mind to think for ourselves, and do what is right for us. Expecting to have a great life while smoking your lungs out is really ridiculous and silly. The main substance that is used in a cigarette is tobacco. First it is burned, then it is inhaled into a person's body. When it settles down and finds a place for itself in the lungs, it forms black holes, which lead to lung cancer. Therefore, I really recommend people stop smoking. You might ask, “why do people sell cigarettes?” Simple: Money. That is the answer; instead of thinking about other people's health, they need the money. However, from the very beginning of your life, safety and health was the most important thing, and it still is. Let's say some people don't really care about their own health, so they think it's okay to smoke, but smoking also harms the people around you. When you inhale smoke, you don't keep it in your lungs; You exhale it back out. Therefore, that smoke can affect other people's lungs too. Smoking is the most popular drug. It is also considered to be addictive. We all don't want to lose our lives like this. Life is the best gift you can get, so let's stop doing what is harmful for our bodies and start caring for them more.
