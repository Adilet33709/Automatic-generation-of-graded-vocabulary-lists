Globalization has erased the wall between countries. This phenomenon, which enables companies to employ people from different countries, demands employers to be not only smart but also street smart in order to survive in this era. Street-smart people know how to deal with daily problems. To achieve this trait, it is important for university students to have a part-time job, because they will learn how to manage their time by having a part-time job. They will also get an opportunity to work as a team player. Students will also learn about time management by having a part-time job. However, it is hard for some people to use their time wisely. Thus, students will learn how to divide their time equally between study and work by having a part-time job. They will also be more responsible at completing assigned tasks within a given time. A good part-time job enables students to work as part of a team. Companies are looking for team players because a team player is able to complete his tasks better than a person who works alone. A person who works in solitude will only be able to make the best decision by comparing his viewpoint with his colleagues’ points of view. This is the reason why companies are looking for team players nowadays. Therefore, it is necessary for university students to have a part-time job in order to be street smart.
