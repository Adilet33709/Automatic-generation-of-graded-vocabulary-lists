After entering college, many people will do part-time jobs to earn money. Their main purpose is to increase their pocket money, and I was no exception. I did many part-time jobs; for example, as a cram school teacher, a waitress, a file manager, and giving away flyers. I even have experience of writing news releases, and in conducting investigations. The main purpose of working is to make money, but I take my part-time job seriously and contribute my enthusiasm. Even when giving away the flyers, I have an amiable mood and I smile to every passerby. When I face my employers, I have a modest and polite attitude. I always modestly learn and do my best, when I do not understand how to do something. Even though bad customers make it difficult for me, I am not discouraged. After all, this is only part of my work. These part-time job experiences let me know how difficult it is to work, and I will be more cautious about the use of my money, though I believe that I may not spend too much money with worry about the society.  After all, I have had many experiences that I cannot learn in school.
