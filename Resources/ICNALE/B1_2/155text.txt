Society has more and more challenges for college students, so it is important for us to have much experience. In our country there are plenty of college students undertaking a part-time job or even more than one part-time job. It's quite common to see students busy after classes. But why is it important for us to have part-time jobs? First, I think part-time jobs are a good way to count our thumbs. College isn't as busy as high school. When we finish our studies, so much time is wasted on playing computer games or doing other boring things. If we have a part-time job, we will try our best to do it. After all, it's a way to show the abilities we have. Second, part-time jobs can help us know more people. Colleges just have students and teachers, but society has quite different people. They do all kinds of work, and experience interesting things of which you have never heard. Through your part-time job, you could develop good interpersonal relationships. After you graduate, you will go into society. When you need help, these people can give it to you. Finally, the most important benefit is that you can get the experience that books can't teach you. Practice is the way to show your knowledge. If you can only talk about how to do it, no one will believe that you can. You have to study what you should do, and part-time jobs would let you experience this. Thus, college students' having a part-time job is necessary and important.
