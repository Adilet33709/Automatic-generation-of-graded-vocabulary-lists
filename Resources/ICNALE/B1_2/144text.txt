The reason the HK government wants to ban smoking in restaurants is to reduce the number of smokers and improve the health condition of Hong Kong citizens. Based on this purpose, it is reasonable to completely ban smoking at all restaurants, including pubs. From the viewpoint of smokers, the ban will restrict them from smoking whenever or wherever they want. They will only be allowed to smoke in their homes. The inconvenience brought by the policy will probably force them to give up smoking. This method is surely much more efficient than just persuading them via TV advertisements. Additionally, passive smoking causes a large amount of deaths worldwide every year and has an especially bad effect on children's development. Aside from health problems, studies have found that passive smoking also harms the intelligence of children. The more children are exposed to passive smoking, the higher the chance of having poor intelligence. Completely banning smoking in all restaurants can reduce the chance of people being exposed to passive smoking. In addition, it is important to maintain a consistent policy. It is not fair for the government to ban only some kinds of restaurants but not all.
