Nowadays, university students have to study different subjects in depth to prepare to enter society. Therefore, studying hard is especially important for university students. However, university students should not spend all of their time studying. It is also important for university students to have a part-time job. First, university students can earn money from a part-time job. There are plenty of expenses in university life such as school fees, living fees, and expenses for entertainment and social activities. As most of the activities are costly, university students have to spend a large amount of money. However, it is difficult for university students to have a full-time job to earn money because they have to study. Therefore, having a part-time job to earn money is the best choice for them. University students can have a part-time job in their spare time, for instance, working as a part-time tutor. Thus, students have extra money to resolve their financial problems and reduce the financial pressure on their families. Therefore, having a part-time job is essential for university students. Moreover, a part-time job provides work experience for university students. It is difficult for university students to get a job after graduating without any working experience. Therefore, if university students have a part-time job, they can reduce the time that they need to spend and they can get a job more easily after graduating. In conclusion, it is crucial for university students to have a part-time job to earn money and get many experiences.
