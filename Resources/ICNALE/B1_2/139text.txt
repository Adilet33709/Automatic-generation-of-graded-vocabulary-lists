I agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I think this because smoking does harm not only to the smoker but also to people around him or her. It goes without saying that smoke is gas. Though we can separate seats, we cannot separate gas. If a smoker sits in a smoking section, and you sit in a non-smoking section near him in a restaurant, the more he smokes, the more smoke you take. In addition, we can reduce the costs and time if smoking is banned. Restaurants will not need to buy and clean ashtrays. You may say that this is too strict for smokers, but if they really want to smoke, they should go to a smoking room that stops the gas from leaking out. I believe this idea sounds very nice for both smokers and non-smokers. And these days, the number of people who smoke is reducing in Japan. The price of smoke is getting higher and higher, and it is troublesome to get even a pack of cigarettes in Japan. Then, how about eliminating cigarettes? They simply do not have any good aspects. They just harm our health. In one of the ways we can help eliminate cigarettes, we can get rid of the smoking sections in restaurants in Japan.
