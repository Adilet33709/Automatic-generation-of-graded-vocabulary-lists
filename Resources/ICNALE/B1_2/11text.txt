In my opinion, it is necessary for college students to have a part-time job once their school grades or other conditions become steady. Why? First, college students are old enough to be financially dependent. They are no longer kids, and they have the responsibility to lessen the pressure on their parents. They have to understand how hard it is to work, so that they can save and never waste their money. Second, they will no longer be students in a few years, so they have to judge what kind of job will suit them through having part-time jobs. Take me as an example. As a male, I have to do the military responsibility first for one year, and then I have to work. I am very afraid now. Many of my classmates are worried about not being able to find a job, and I may face the same situation in one year's time. One of my classmates declined the chance to be a teacher in kindergarten, because she found herself having no interest in education. And some of my classmates felt sad and worried after job interviews, because they found they didn't have the skills or experiences that the bosses wanted. So I think it's good to test college students' abilities by having a part-time job.
