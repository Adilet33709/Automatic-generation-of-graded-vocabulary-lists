I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have three reasons why it is important. First of all, they should work in order to maintain their livelihood. There are many students who under financial difficulty. We can't live if we do not eat. If there is no energy, no life can live. The second reason is conversation skills. It is very important because we need social skill to succeed in society. We should talk to other people to get what we need. It will allow us to learn from real life rather than from a teacher. I believe that part-time jobs help to improve this skill. The last reason is to reinforce our university major. I hope that if you want to have a part-time job, you will consider what your major is and what kind of part time job will help you. For example, my major is English literature. To study English and to improve my ability, I will find a part-time job which is related to English. For these reasons, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
