After that, it increased disastrously when refugees came to Pakistan from Afghanistan across the Pak-Afghan border. As far as the harms of smoking are concerned, it is disastrous for health. It can cause cancer and it destroys lungs. It causes breathing problems. Its harm is not only confined to health. When a smoker gets addicted to smoking, he can go to any limits. An addict cannot concentrate on his work. He goes for cigarettes every now and then. His family is affect by it. In the case of financially weak people, smoking can ruin lives. There are several cases when smokers who need money for cigarettes have sold their houses, and ended up selling their houses one by one.
