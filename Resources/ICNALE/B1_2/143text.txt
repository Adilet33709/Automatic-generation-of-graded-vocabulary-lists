I disagree with the statement. Although I am not a smoker, I have friends who are and I empathize with their situation here in Singapore, where there are many areas that are out of bounds to smokers. There are even fines if one smokes at bus stops or in other non-smoking areas. Smoking in restaurants can affect many diners, especially if the smoke interferes with their consumption of food. I do agree that it can be uncomfortable for diners and perhaps even irritating. However, I argue that to completely ban smoking in all restaurants is unfair to smokers. There should be a smoking corner or a smoking room instead, which can help smokers take a break and relax during their meals. This will definitely be more appreciated than banning smoking in restaurants entirely. It also infringes on their right and freedom to smoke, which is ironic, especially in a country that promotes freedom and equality. If the government wants to completely ban smoking in a particular area, then why do they even allow the sale of cigarettes in the first place? It is this irony that exists in public places that creates confusion and conflict among people, and smokers in particular.
