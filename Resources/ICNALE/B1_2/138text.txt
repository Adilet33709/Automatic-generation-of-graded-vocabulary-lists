I completely agree with this statement. I have four reasons why I agree with this statement. First, holding a variety of part-time jobs serves to build our experience. For example, if I were to work in a convenience store, I could learn to have a good smile and a good greeting style, or If I were to work in a factory, I could learn patience and understand how appliances are made by the factory. We can receive many diverse experiences by doing part-time jobs. Second, if I hold a variety work part-time jobs, I can find a fitting future job or major. For example, I work at an institute for my money, but fortunately I can find my job by working in an institute that teaches for students. Then I can decide my dream. Also, I can endeavor for my dream and I don't need to wander anymore. Third, I can know the value and concept of money. If I were hardly earning any money, the money I had would be priceless. Therefore, I can't waste the money. I try to save the money and know my parent's difficulty in earning money. Finally, Steve Jobs said "Connect the dots", so I take on a variety of part-time jobs that surely someday will help me. In conclusion, I assert that part-time jobs are necessary for college students.
