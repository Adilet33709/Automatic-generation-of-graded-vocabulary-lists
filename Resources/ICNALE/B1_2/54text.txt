This is very important for us to follow, because it is not just that smoking is dangerous for the smoker, which could cause a lot of diseases such as cancer and heart attacks, but it could also harm people near to the smoker; these people are called passive smokers, and these poor people will suffer more than the smoker because they inhale the smoke directly from the cigarette. Not to mention that a cigarette contains some substances that are addictive. Maybe it is as addictive as a drug because it makes people want more. Some restaurants in this country still allow customers to smoke. I think that is not a good way to develop a restaurant because their smoke can be very annoying, and it could also change the taste of food from that restaurant. It is true that some restaurants provide a special room for those who smoke, but that alone won't really help to ban people from smoking. That will only give them a special privilege, or something like a special room for them. A way to stop them is to not give smokers an option at all, a no smoking area. If only every restaurant wanted to applied this, but sadly they don't, and that is why smokers still exist in restaurants.
