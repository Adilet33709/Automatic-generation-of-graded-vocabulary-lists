I completely agree with this statement. A variety of groups visit restaurants - kids, juveniles, adults who have quit smoking, old people who don't like the smell of smoke, etc. If kids and juveniles were exposed to smoke or see smoking, smoking is very harmful for them. Some curious kids and juveniles think "I want to smoke", and if adults who have quit smoking were to smell the smoke, they may be tempted to smoke again and damage their health. Buying tobacco is expensive, so if smokers were to quit smoking, they would save money and they could spend that money more meaningfully. For example, they could make a donation for Africans who don't have money, food, water, or medicine, and save their life from disease. Or they could spend money on their family household goods. Also tobacco is very addictive - the so-called "legal drug". Above all, smoking is very harmful and secondhand smoking is very hazardous for health. I insist that we ban smoking in restaurants. If a smoking ban was not enacted by law, the nation should implement smoking areas. And if they were disobeying the law, the government should punish lawbreakers ruthlessly with considerable penalties including long periods of jail and community service.
