I definitely agree with banning smoking at all restaurants. In fact, although it is hard to achieve, I hope that smoking can be completely banned at all public spaces someday. Although some people think smoking makes them feel comfortable and relaxed, the truth is, cigarettes do hardly anything but harm our health. And most importantly, people should have the right to refuse breathing in second-hand smoke. Restaurants are public spaces; therefore, people who want to smoke should consider others who might not be pleased to dine in an atmosphere full of smoke. After all, if the whole restaurant is full of smoke, how can you enjoy the smell of the food and taste it in good mood? People who have the habit of smoking should know that not everyone can stand the smell of it; in fact, the smell of smoke is terrible for some people who do not smoke at all. Moreover, it is obvious that smoking or breathing in second-hand smoke harms our health. Thus, the next time you step into a restaurant, even if you don't care about your lungs, please respect the rights of others in the same restaurant who might not want to breathe in your second-hand smoke.
