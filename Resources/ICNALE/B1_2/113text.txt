Part-time jobs are important to college students. College students have many social activities, like clubs, parties, and some competitions. They want to make more friends and experience a different life, so they spend more. Because they spend more, they need some extra money in their pocket. So, some college students find part-time jobs such as a tutor. If the working hours are too long, sometimes those college students will delay their studies, but they are usually shortsighted. They think that earning money is much more important than studying well. They waste their time on part-time jobs and join too many activities. As a result, some people suspend their schooling to get more part-time jobs. When they grow older, they will regret their decision; it is like putting the cart before the horse. They give up their studies for a meager salary. That's really ridiculous. As far as I am concerned, maybe I would get a part-time job if I had much free time, like the summer or winter vacations, or if I can pass the course easily. The most important thing is to complete the course you are there to study. Then, after you graduate, you will find a better job.
