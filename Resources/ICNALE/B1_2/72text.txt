Recently, more and more people are smoking in Hong Kong, even though smoking has been proved to be unhealthy. As a result, the question of whether to ban smoking in all restaurants has become a controversial issue. In my opinion, although smoking is one’s right, non-smokers who are sitting in the same restaurant should by no means be forced to inhale any of the smoke. Therefore, smoking should immediately be banned at all restaurants in our city. As we all know, smoking leads to severe illnesses such as lung cancer and heart disease. In addition, when one smokes, the air around is inevitably contaminated with harmful smoke. Therefore, nearby customers have to breathe in the smokers’ smoke. Let us consider for a moment if we had three meals  a day at restaurants and spent 30 minutes eating each meal how much smoke we would we breathe in and how our health would be affected. The only result is that our health would deteriorate. What is more, the deterioration of our health would increase the workload of public hospitals and lead to a higher death rate. Under no circumstances should the public’s health be sacrificed for the selfish behavior of smokers. Therefore, smoking must be completely banned at all restaurants.
