It is common for a university student to have a part-time job as a private tutor, sales representative, bank officer, and so on. Some people argue that students should focus on their studies at university and not have a part-time job. They say that doing a part-time job would make them focus less on the lessons and spend less time doing homework and revision. However, from my point my view, it is important for university students to have a part-time job. Firstly, part-time jobs help university students to enter the society. After their studies at university, students will need to start to working in the society. Doing part-time jobs can help students to gain work experience and learn some specific abilities that will be useful in finding a job after their graduation. In addition, part-time jobs help university students to earn a living. University students usually need to stay in halls due to the distance between their home and university. The daily meal and hall fees are a heavy burden for them. It is therefore a good idea for them to have a part-time job to lighten the burden. They can also become independent by earning money for themselves instead of asking their parents for money. To sum up, doing part-time jobs has more advantages than disadvantages for university students. Therefore, university students should have a part-time job.
