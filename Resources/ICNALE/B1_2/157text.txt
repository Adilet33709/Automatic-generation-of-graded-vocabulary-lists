I think it is good if it is necessary for college students to have a part-time job. It is good to have some work experience while in school, as more work experience might help you have more chance than others to get the job you want after you leave school. This means, it may bring you more competitive advantage than others. You can also learn how to get along with people and understand the difficulty of earning money, and it may make you more mature. However, as we may spend almost all our lives seeking work and working hard for money, I don't think it is necessary for us to start it during our school life. People always want to be adults in their childhood and want to be students when they start working. There are many things we can do only in school. Unless there are economy problems, I don't think spending time at a part-time job is worthwhile. Moreover, for those who cannot manage their time well, it is possible to spend too much time and energy on a part-time job, which may cause students' school grades to drop. Thus, if there is no need to get a part-time job, I think students should enjoy their college life. Don't be too eager to step into your business life or you may regret it.
