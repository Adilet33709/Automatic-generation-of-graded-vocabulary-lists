There are a variety of part time jobs currently. Students can generate income for themselves. It also helps alleviate the financial burdens of the family and working part time helps with work experience. Students recognize the patience needed to work. They meet people in society from many backgrounds. At present, many students are working alongside university. Students have to have the patience and diligence for working and studying. Some students may agree that a part time job is necessary for life but somehow it's optional to choose. There are many reasons for having a part time job such as earning money, gaining experiences, or expanding networking. Some part time jobs pay a lot of money to students while some jobs paying very little. Personally, I think having a part time job depends on personal reasons. If I have more time and I want to buy something expensive, I may look for a part time job so that I can buy that thing by myself. Having a part time job while studying is not popular in Thailand. We are supported by our families and they always state that we should focus on studying only. This is why we are different from other countries, where the families teach the students to have a part time job so that they can stand on their own feet. In conclusion, I agree with having a part time job if it's necessary to do so.
