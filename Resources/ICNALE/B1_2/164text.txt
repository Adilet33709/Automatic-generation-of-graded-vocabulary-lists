In Hong Kong, there are so many university students who have found part-time jobs, it seems that it is a very important thing that every university student must do. However, is having a part-time job that important? I do not think so. In the following, I am going to explain my view. First, the things that can be learned from a part-time job can be also learned from many other places. Many students claim that a part-time job can help them to improve their communication and leadership skills. That is the major reason why people think finding a part-time job is important. However, we can also achieve this aim in other ways such as being a committee member of societies. In the other words, finding a part-time job is not the only way to achieve this goal. Second, the work experience gained from a part-time job is not as useful as what most people claim. Since the part-time job is probably not related to the student’s future career, the work experience is not counted when they want to find a job in the future. To conclude, owing to the above reasons, I do not think finding a part-time job is very important.
