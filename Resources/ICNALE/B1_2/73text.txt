A part-time job is a type of employment that has fewer work hours than a full-time job. It is work or employment of an odd or occasional nature with specific tasks or responsibilities undertaken for a fixed price. The most common types of employment for part-time jobs are: bussing tables, babysitting, gas station attending, taking care of the elderly, doing secretarial work, library assistant, filing papers in offices, house to house, newspaper delivery, dog walking, and tutoring. Most of the time, college students are dependent on their parents, and must sometimes ask for a large amount of money to buy something that is not really needed. Because of this, college students should have part-time jobs to earn money so that they are not very dependent on their parents' money. Part-time jobs can give students the feeling of working and earning their own money and, in that way they, they will understand the value of money. Part-time jobs can also be a training ground for college students, preparing them for the future so that after they graduate they can be confident that they can survive in the real world. However, not all college students have parents who can support them financially and they can only go to college because of scholarships. Thus, such students get part-time jobs to help their parents financially and so that they do not feel that they are a burden to the family. Being a college student, there are a lot of things that we spend money on for education, so we need to get a part-time job to alleviate some of the financial burden on our parents. It can also help us to be more mature in handling money.
