I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking is like a drug. It makes people become addicted. Most people know that smoking is bad for their health, but many people still don't stop smoking. Doctors always warn us that smoking causes cancer, heart problems, and lung disease. Another problem is that smoking creates smoke, and the smoke from the cigarettes pollutes the air. This smoke also causes a bad smell and make people feel uncomfortable. The smoke produces "second-hand smoke", which is the smoke breathed in by people near a smoker. It makes non-smokers feel bad and can cause the same illnesses that smokers suffer from. So second-hand smoking harms other people, as well as the smoker. It's time for all governments in the world to ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country. If you want to enjoy your delicious dinner, you don't want to smell smoke. Non-smoking restaurants will be a tendency when more and more people pay attention to their health. Thus, there is no reason why this "drug" should be legal. The governments should raise the wine and tobacco tax to lower the number of people buying cigarettes in order to achieve the goal of a non-smoking environment for all people.
