I disagree with that opinion. I think that it is not important for college students to have a part-time job. There are two main reasons. The first reason is that students should study. What students have to do is study, but some students can't study enough because of their part-time job. For example, my friend has a part-time job teaching English to elementary school students. She is so busy everyday preparing for teaching. She often checks their answers to examinations even during classes at  university. Also, she is likely to be late for a class because she has to prepare for teaching all night. I don't think it is good for her. In that case, her part-time job prevents her from studying. The second reason is that many students spend most of their salary playing, not living. They mainly spend their money on clothes, their hobby, dating, traveling and so on. This means that most of them don't work for a living. For instance, my friend who I stated above is one such student. She lives with her family and doesn't have to work. However, she wants to get more clothes and to follow fashion. In closing, I don't want to say students must not have a part-time job, but it is not so important for them. Therefore, I think it is unimportant for college students to have a part-time job.
