Currently in our community in the Philippines it is pretty tough to even get money, much less to work for it. Here, students are working just to fulfil the needs of their families and themselves. Working part-time means that students must be more mature and come of age earlier. For most of our lives, we students merely rely on pocket money from our parents, but sometimes even that is not even enough to enable us to buy what we want and need. Some schools forbid students from working part-time because it violates school policy. Unfortunately, this does not stop students from taking different kinds of jobs for extra cash. Yet, working part time does not mean students need money to sustain only themselves, they may also need to sustain their families. There are some cases where a student's parents cannot afford the tuition for school, and the student must take matters into their own hands by stopping their education and working part-time, or occasionally taking a full-time job. Sadly, because our economy is still not improving, for everyone's sake, students have to work whether they like it or not.
