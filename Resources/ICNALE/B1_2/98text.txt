In the present, most people who have a part-time job are not always workers but can be someone who has not graduated yet, often a high school student or college student. In my opinion, I think there are two ways to think about whether it is important or not for college students to have a part-time job. First, I think that college students should intend to study. Second, if we look at another side, we will see that a part-time job is good for some students who have less money. Nowadays, in college, they usually finish class early and they do not have to study all day like students in high school. Therefore, it is easy if they want to get a part-time job, and I think it is a good idea for college students to have part-time jobs because they can get lessons from outside the classroom. This is sometimes better than just sitting and studying in school or college, and they can also get life experience. Finally, I think part-time jobs might teach them many things. For example, it can help them to manage time in daily life, train themselves to have responsibility, always be on time, spend free time usefully, help with their expenses, learn how to use and keep money and lastly, and help their thinking process or how to fix a problem they face.
