Nowadays, as most college students have no considerable social experience, what they have learned and what they are going to learn seem to become alienated from reality. Thus, the question of whether college students should have a part-time job has aroused wide attention. Indeed, we should attach more importance to part-time jobs. College students can benefit a lot from having a part-time job. To begin with, we can earn some money in order to lighten our parents' financial load. As we all know, college tuition is not a small sum of money. Some students pay a lot for it, only to gain little knowledge in their college lives. Beyond that, it is also a heavy burden, especially for a less well-off family. Besides, in the course of the job, we have to cope with a variety of people and communicate various words. Obviously, it is a great opportunity for us to gather experience and learn interpersonal skills. Further, what we learn from the part-time job can contribute to the future development of excellence. Last but not least, we can adjust ourselves to the society in advance. When we enter society, there are many objective factors that you can never change or foresee. That is to say, what we learn in college is theoretical and not enough for us to face all kinds of situations. It is because of the part-time job that we learn to combine theory with practice. From this, we can draw the conclusion that it is important for college students to have part-time jobs.
