It is reported by the World Health Organization that there have been more than five million deaths caused by smoking. It is easy to see that smoking is very bad for our health. What's worse, second-hand smoking hurts our bodies without our knowledge. This problem is so serious that we have to do something to protect ourselves. The most effective and easiest suggestion is banning smoking at all the restaurants in the country. Most people in the world don't like to smoke and large numbers of them even hate it because of its uncomfortable gas. So banning smoking not only meets people's will, but also saves their lives. Tobacco is also very expensive, which means that smoking wastes a lot of money, and that quitting smoking can save money. The restaurant is the most important pubic place in our daily life, so banning smoking here can lead to the biggest and best effects. We do not want to be hurt when we have a good time, which would be very disappointing. Another reason is that a restaurant is a closed space with minimal airflow. People do not move often in restaurants, so bad gas can't be dispelled and can cause great harm. There is no benefit that we can take from smoking. Smoking greatly hurts smokers' and others' health. Thus, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.
