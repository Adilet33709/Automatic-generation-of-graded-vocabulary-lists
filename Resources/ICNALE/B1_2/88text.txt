Just like almost everyone else, we see people smoking every day, in almost all places imaginable. Born and raised in the Philippines, a third-world developing nation, and a country where the impoverished resort to smoking to suppress their hunger, I am no stranger to smoking. Whether it is outside our homes, near our schools, along roads, in malls, and even outside hospitals, people smoke. Recently, however, smoking has begun to take flak. There have been clamours to ban smoking in public areas, specifically restaurants, as it is hazardous to public health and therefore public interest. Blessed with the opportunity for education, we have learned from a very young age the risks and perils of smoking, and equally important – second-hand smoke. From consequences such as addiction and reduced cardiovascular endurance to possible death, smoking, and the even more hazardous unfiltered second-hand smoke, clearly are not things to be taken lightly. People patronize restaurants despite their higher prices compared with convenience stores, fast food, and cafeterias, not only because of the usually better tasting food options but also because of the ambiance – the environment. Despite the sheer number of smokers in the country, there are also many who value their health and, as such, support the notion of penalizing smoking in restaurants. This is why I believe that it is in the interest of the majority, and therefore the public, that smoking be generally banned in restaurants across the country, but with a few reservations. We cannot impede the smokers' own rights; therefore, I also believe that smoking should be allowed in select food institutions that cater primarily to smokers.
