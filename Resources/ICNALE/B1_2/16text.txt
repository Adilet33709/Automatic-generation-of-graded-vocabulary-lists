Smoking is the act of inhaling and puffing out visible, finely divided matter or vapor that is formed during the combustion of dried tobacco leaves. Smoking just a single cigarette can cause hundreds of toxins to enter the body. Some of the toxins that are present in a cigarette stick are nicotine, which is addictive and increases the level of cholesterol in the body; carbon monoxide, which reduces the oxygen in the body; and tar, which is a carcinogen (a substance that causes cancer) and gets accumulated in the air passages of the lung. If these are the toxins that enter your body, imagine what will happen if you smoke in a restaurant where there are families bringing their kids, pregnant mothers, and people who have asthma. In this type of environment, if you smoke, there will be a lot of second-hand smokers who will also inhale the toxins that are present in the fumes of the cigarette. If a person in the restaurant has asthma, there is a high possibility that inhaling a cigarette's fumes may trigger an asthma attack. Aside from that, if you smoke in a restaurant, it can also cause second-hand smokers' cancer, especially in the lungs, as well as cardiovascular diseases, emphysema, vascular diseases, and other obstructive lung diseases. If you smoke in a restaurant and there is a pregnant mother who inhales the fumes of the cigarette, the baby will not have enough oxygen and will be born small for its gestational age. As a conclusion, if you smoke inside a restaurant, not only smokers will experience the bad effects but also the people who are inside the restaurant. So either smokers should not smoke inside restaurants or they should go to a place where there is no one around to smoke.
