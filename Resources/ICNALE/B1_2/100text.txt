The trend of a part-time job is very common in Pakistan and other countries, especially European countries, because parents cannot support their children for their basic needs. It is very common, especially among students who are not rich and if their parents cannot afford to spend their money on their studies. A part-time job means to do a job during their studies; there are many reasons for getting a part-time job. Students do a lot of work to support themselves. In the morning, they attend schools, colleges, or universities, and in the evening, they work. Some students do part-time jobs just for fun or based on their interest but others really need to do them. I think it is unnecessary for college students and students to do part-time jobs because of their family problems. Parents who insist their child support the family because their income is not enough to support the whole family and make their children study at the same time place a heavy burden on their children; they either lose their health or they are unable to do either thing properly. However, some children are very talented. They can do a job and assign a proper amount of time to their studies. Their academic record is good. I think if students do not need a job then they should not do one, they should just focus on their studies with their full concentration.
