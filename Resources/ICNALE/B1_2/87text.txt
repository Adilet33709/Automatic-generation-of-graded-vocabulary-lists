My part-time jobs have been very unique and different from the norm. I do not go to companies to work as a admin stuff during my weekends, but instead I have been working as a tutor and a kindergarten gymnastics trainer. I enjoy both of my jobs very much, as not only do they pay well but it is also really fun and interesting to interact with the children. Their ages for the kindergarten gymnastic classes range from pre-nursery to k2s. The kids are extremely cute when they recognize you and try to be close to you. The small-talk with them has also been very interesting. They are simply hilarious. The children that I tutor range in age from primary five to primary six. I find this job more tiring but they are still interesting people. I remember feeling extremely lazy going and tutoring after a long day in school. However, I still had to be responsible enough to go. Also, many times I wanted to skip tutoring if I had a test or exam the following day, but their exams were more important than mine. In the end, I still had to go and teach them. However, it is satisfying when you see improvements in their grades.
