I totally agree with the idea of Topic B (Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.) Let's see some reasons. First of all, there are lots of people who don't like the smell of smoking. For example, a month ago, I went to a restaurant near a mountain. On one hand, I liked the place because of the air around it; on the other hand, I saw a person who was smoking in the restaurant, and that makes me feel uncomfortable. I really hate the smell of smoking and when I smell it, I get a headache, so it was terrible dinner due to that person. Secondly, secondhand smoking is fatal for people's health. As you know, secondhand smoking is much worse than smoking. Therefore, smoking in public place affects other people who are in public place as well as the smoker Thirdly, there is a possibility of a fire. In this case, many people who are in the public place are going to die. Fourthly, smoking in public places makes young people or children have curiosity about it or makes them want to smoke. That's why smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
