I don't think that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in Japan. I have some reasons to follow this idea. It is true that smoking hurts humans’ health and cigarette smoke also hurts non-smokers. But, smokers have rights and freedom of choice when it comes to smoking. Only forbidding smoking doesn’t make smokers’ smoking manners better. Of course, non-smokers’ health is really important. Smoking without manners will cause a lot of conflict. I have some ideas to solve this problem. First, distinguish smoking and non-smoking seats more strictly. Almost all restaurants, of course, distinguish them already. But, most restaurants distinguish them only by space. I think that this is not enough. I propose that restaurants separate these places by walls. By doing this, smokers can smoke as they please, and non-smokers don't have to worry about the damage to their health caused by the smoke. It doesn't have to take much tax; only a little will work. Second, increase the tax on cigarettes. If smokers need more money for smoking, they will reduce their smoking a little more, at least, in restaurants. Based on these reasons and solutions, I think it is too strict to say that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in Japan.
