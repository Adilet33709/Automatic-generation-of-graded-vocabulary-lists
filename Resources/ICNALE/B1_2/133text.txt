In my opinion, to smoke is absolutely a bad thing to do. For me, among the members of my family we have no one who is a smoker. My father always tells us that it is bad and I really trust him. Do you think that drugs are good? Of course not. In the case of something such as tea or coffee, which are drugs too, they don't destroy our health as much as smoking. I don't think that it's a good idea. Some people say that although they are relaxed, their bodies are being destroyed by the thing that they think is good for them. I think if somebody is serious, exercising might help them more than smoking. Do you think that too? For an easy example, if you are very hungry, and there is a poison apple and ingredients for apple pie in front of you, what would you choose? The clever people will choose the ingredients for apple pie, right? Although it might take time to bake a pie and you want to eat an apple, you know that if you eat a poison apple, you will die after you get full. Thus, you must choose the slower but better one. In addition, between exercising or playing sports and smoking, the stupid people always choose the faster one. They do not care about results, they know just that they are very hungry and they want to eat an apple right now. Trust me, in the future, they will feel sorry about what they've done. Lastly, I know that everybody has their own rights, so I can't forbid anyone from smoking, but hopefully they will learn someday that a poison apple is not good for them and that there are many people who love them and don't want them to destroy themselves.
