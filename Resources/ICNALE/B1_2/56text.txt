In college, there are lots of students talking about, thinking about, and working a part-time job. There are many kinds of work that college students like such as being a server, cashier, etc. Do you think it is necessary for college students? If you ask me about having a part-time job when you study in college, I can think of both sides, good and bad things. If you talk about the families that are not rich enough to spend money on studying in college, I think working part-time is important. When you study in college, you can only just learn and learn but if you don't have enough money for eating, living, or buying books, you must have a part-time job for this thing. In other words, if you have enough money for everything, I think a part-time job is unnecessary for you because when you work a part-time job you will not have much time for rest, reading books, or working on your homework. If you want to work a part-time job, you must manage your time for everything you have to do first. If you have much free time, you can work on a part-time job. When you manage everything clearly, I think part-time work will give you more experience for working and you will have more money for shopping.
