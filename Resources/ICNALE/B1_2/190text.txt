I think it important for college students to have a part-time job. I have two reasons why I think this. First, they need money. It costs a lot of money to enter a university. Of course, it is not the students but their parents that paid the money. I believe that students should pay back the money more or less to their parents, and some students want to go to graduate school. In addition, generally, college students spend a lot of money. For example, they spend money on buying nice clothes or shoes, hanging out with their friends and participating in club activities. For another reason, through working, they can learn how the society is. A part-time job teaches them how to make good relationships with other team members and their boss. They attain various kinds of skills and learn how strict and severe rules are. They will also learn how difficult it is to make money. You may say that if you work too hard in your part-time job, it causes bad effects on your study in university. This is true, but, actually, students have the ability to control their own shifts to some extent. If they want to earn a lot of money in a short time, they should work as a cram school teacher. Besides, I have a lot of friends who work really hard and get great school records. That is why having a part-time job is necessary for college students.
