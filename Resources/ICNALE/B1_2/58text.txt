I'm all for part-time jobs. These days, most students have a part-time job because they can't live on pocket money from their parents and they don't have enough money to go to university. Entry money is so expensive, too, so we cannot help but work a part-time job. I have a part-time job, too. If the entry pay will be low, we don't have to get a part-time job, but now the entry money is expensive. As such, poor students should have a part-time job. Having a part-time job will help to raise independence. While working, I can earn some money for myself. In addition, it will be good to have the experience of working at a store if one wants to open such a store themselves. However, there is demerit of having jobs that is accumulation of stress. Because we cannot earn much money in a short time. Finally, if you have a dream of what you want to do, you can choose the right part-time job so you can gain some experience before your dream comes true. So I agree to have a part-time job while in university. Accordingly, I made my position to agree with this idea.
