I am a smoker. One smokes for different reasons. Teenagers smoke for fun. Doctors may smoke to relieve the pressure of performing surgery. Soldiers smoke because their days are boring. However, smoking is bad for smokers and may be even worse for non-smokers. Nevertheless, there are ways to prevent banning smoking at restaurants, or it would be unfair for those smokers. The government can divide all the restaurants into two parts: one for smokers, the other for non-smokers. In this way, there is a solution to resolve the problem. If one day, the government puts it into practice, this may somehow become unreasonable. If one day smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants, gradually we may start to regulate other places to ban smoking including schools and hospitals. But we have to know that smoking does have its value. Without smoking, this world can't work in a good situation. We should never eliminate anything at random without neglecting its result. Smoking may even be a remedy to cure patients. Some people may live on it to earn money. This could not be banned completely, because it is a habit, and it can even be a fashion among many great people.
