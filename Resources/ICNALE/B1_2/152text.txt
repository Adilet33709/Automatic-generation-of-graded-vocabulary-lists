In the country, not everyone likes smoking. Due to this problem, a lot of restaurant managers set up a smoking corner in their restaurants. We know that smoking is harmful for our health, so why don't those managers ban smoking in their restaurants? First, I think that it is because smoking is a habit. Moreover, it is not illegal. If smoking were banned, it would cause a big problem. Second, the restaurant is an important social place where people chat with each other. If someone's habit is banned in the restaurant, he or she must be more passive when at the restaurant than before. Thus, it will damage business if managers directly ban smoking in their restaurants. Therefore, it is difficult for us to ban smoking in restaurants in the country. We can support smokers to reduce the number of cigarettes they smoke, but we cannot just ban it. Of course, setting up a new smoking corner or upgrading it is the major cure for smoking. If it is useful to prevent harm from smoking, then we do not have to deal with this problem with a too severe heart.
