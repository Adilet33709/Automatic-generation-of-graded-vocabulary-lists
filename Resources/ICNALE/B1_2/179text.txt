Now I am studying at Mae Fah Luang University, Chiang Rai, Thailand. I am studying in the school of liberal arts as an English major. I agree with part-time jobs. Part-time jobs can make teenagers more responsible and develop their own personality. Teenagers who work part-time jobs can practice to be careful when they meet many kinds of people. They will know benefits of money and how hard it is to earn it. I agree with a part-time job. The first reason is part-time jobs can help teenagers prepare for adult life and must have more responsibility. When teenagers take a part-time job must be responsible to manage time for study, relax, work, and travel. Next, teenagers can learn how to live with other people and adjust to unfamiliar environments. Third, teenagers learn what they want in the future. They can plan what they have to learn that will be useful for their future jobs. Finally, teenagers will know the benefits of money, how hard it is to earn it. I think that no one wants to waste money that they have in exchange of their efforts. In conclusion, part-time jobs are a good idea to prepare teenagers to be adults. I hope that schools or universities and parents will support young people to work part-time jobs.
