A part-time job means to do extra work somewhere within your routine duties. Nowadays, most people do part-time jobs due to inflation, especially the majority of students, who do part-time jobs after finishing their days at college or university. Students do part-time jobs for many reasons. Students who belong to middle class or poor families do part-time jobs to help their parents fulfill their educational needs. They do not want to become a burden on their parents. On the other hand, students who belong to the upper class also do part-time jobs for enjoyment. However, the majority of students who do a part-time job belong to middle-class families to help themselves and their parents. Nevertheless, part-time jobs can affect the students’ studies because they have less time for their studies, and they cannot concentrate on their studies, especially if their job is very hard. Therefore, students doing part-time jobs should have to choose a type of job that is not too hard or time-consuming. Although part-time jobs have negative effects on students’ studies, there are also many benefits for students. They become confident and get to know themselves better, and they get experience in their practical life about how to survive and how to meet other people. Therefore, we can make a conclusion that part-time jobs should be necessary for all college students because they should learn how to manage their time while doing a part-time job and have a better understanding of choosing a future job for themselves.
