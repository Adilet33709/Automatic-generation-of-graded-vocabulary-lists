As college students, we aren't very busy, so we can spend a lot of time doing the things we like. Some students do sports, such as playing football and running. Some students play computer games, such as dota and dnf. Some students read books, such as novels and poetry. What I think is the most important thing we should do in our free time is working in a part-time job. College is an important place connecting school and society. We not only learn knowledge here, but also learn experience which we can't learn from class. Thus, having a part-time job can solve this problem. In fact, a part-time job can make our college life substantial. From the part-time job, we can learn how to deal with work problems and how to work with others. We can also develop good habits. The most important lesson is that we can understand how hard making money is, so that we can make a good preparation for later life. College life is colorful, so we don't need to study as hard as we did in senior high school. We should learn to allocate our time and know what we really need. Having a part-time job is important to us; it's not only an opportunity, but also a challenge.
