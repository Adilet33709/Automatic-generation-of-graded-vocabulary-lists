There is currently a controversial debate on part-time jobs, concerning whether we should take a part-time job and how much time we should spend on a part-time job. It is natural that people from different backgrounds hold divergent attitudes towards the issue. People in favor of having a part-time job claim that it can release their financial burdens, especially as it is already common for young people to bear a loan from the bank to support their families or themselves. Further, a part-time job may even entertain the person as well as bring in money, if the job relates to his or her interest. In this way, people will make full use of their time and be energetic all the time. In contrast, people who hold the opposite opinion argue that a part-time job will occupy a big share of people’s attention and may lead them to poor health. They cannot focus their full attention on their main work, which is why part-time jobs are banned in lots of companies. For my part, I would side with the first point of view. Part-time jobs do fill our spare time when we have the passion to do something interesting and attractive. So seek a part-time job, and be rich both in wealth and spirit.
