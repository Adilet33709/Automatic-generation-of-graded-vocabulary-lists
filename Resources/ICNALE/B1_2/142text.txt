I think the answer is based on the student’s situation in life. If a student belongs to a rich family it is not important for him/ her to find a part-time job. However, if the student wants to become independent he/she needs to have a part-time job to sustain his/her needs and wants. Having a part time job at a young age gives the student extra experience and makes him/ her a more mature person. By contrast, when a student belongs to a poor family it is really important for him/ her to have a job because this can help to lessen any financial problems. The student can also gain experience that he/she can use when he/she wants to find a job after studying. A part-time job provides students with some skills, abilities, and different experiences. The student can develop his/her personality and improve their attitude towards other people. While on the bad side, the student’s studies are affected; the student cannot focus only on his/her lessons from school. It is also bad for the student’s health if it over works his/her body. Yet, of course all of us have a reason for everything that we do, this is why even though there are bad effects, we do things for the best.
