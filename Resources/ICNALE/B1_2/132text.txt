I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Of course, I have a part-time job. A part-time job can be a valuable experience. Many high school students are banned from having a part-time job. Even if they want to work, their parents and teachers ban them from doing it. Yet, college students are free to have one  and have a lot of time. They should have a part-time job unless they are absent from classes because of it. Through a part-time job, I learned the difficulty of earning. Therefore, I learned to use money very carefully. This is an important thing in my life. Some people who did not have a part-time job when they are college students will not know the difficulty until they get a job. Then it is too late. People are not apt to forget things which they learned when they were young. My mother said it is very valuable for young people to have trouble. So, we should experience many things and get a correct view, the right way to think and so on. Those who acquired these will live comfortably as a result. A great life waits for them.
