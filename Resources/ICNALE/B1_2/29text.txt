On January 1st, 2007, the government announced that smoking in indoor areas is prohibited. However, smoking in restaurants is not included in this category because the restaurant owners claimed that banning smoking in the restaurants would affect their business and fewer customers would be willing to come. On the other hand, according to a newspaper, 80% of the customers agree with banning smoking in restaurants. In my opinion, smoking should be banned in all restaurants. To begin with, smoking in the restaurant affects other customers. Non-smoking customers are supposed to have a comfortable environment for them to enjoy their food and talk with their friends. Smokers in the restaurant will create secondhand smoke and make the environment unpleasant. Furthermore, smokers create a lot of dirt in the restaurants. Some smokers leave their cigarettes and ash on the floor, which affects the cleanliness of the restaurants. The owner of the restaurant will need to take the time to clean it, and this dirty environment could reduce the number of customers. Briefly, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. This can benefit both the owner and the customers of the restaurants. The government should set up laws to ban and penalize smokers in restaurants.
