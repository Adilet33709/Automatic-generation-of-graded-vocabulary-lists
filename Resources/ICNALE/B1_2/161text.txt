It is common sense that smoking does great harm to people's health. Thus, I am for the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As we all know, a small cigarette contains a great amount of harmful substances. Undoubtedly, the one smoking is constantly exposing his lungs to those substances, which, according to many researches, damage not only the lungs but also the heart and digestive system. Besides, second-hand smokers are victims as well. Although they are not addicted to smoking, they are affected unconsciously when staying in a room full of poisonous smoke. The restaurant is a place where people enjoy themselves by eating delicious food. As a result, a clean and comfortable environment should be provided instead of one that is full of cigarette smoke. At least, the health of children cannot be ignored. In other words, these are the very reasons why we should do something. In fact, some countries have banned smoking in public places years ago. Facing an increasing rate of diseases caused by smoking, we may as well try to take forceful measures, such as making laws, to reduce smoking in public places, and now, to stop smoking in all public places.
