It is really up to the college student if he/she can manage both education and work. However, if it was me, I would rather study first before applying for a job. As an engineering student, and a chemical one at that, it is wise to focus on education as it is very challenging. From developing complicated solutions and diagram graphing, to writing essays and theses, I disagree with students applying or working part-time jobs. Even though working part-time can give us a taste of what it is like in the working world, it may also drag our grades down due to the overwhelming responsibilities of both school and work. With both responsibilities, you have less time for recreational activities and even for sleep. You will have less time to make or bond with friends, thus having less time for social activities. In missing out on these activities, you will lose friends that may be beneficial in the future to help you out. You will not acquire the skills to socialize, which will also be needed in full-time employment. You may also acquire these skills in part-time jobs with your co-workers, but of course, it is different talking with friends than with older co-workers. I am not trying to take the privilege of working part-time away from those who really need it. It is just my opinion. If some people are able to manage their time well, and are really need to work due to family problems, then by all means apply for a part-time job now.
