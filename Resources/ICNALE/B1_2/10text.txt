I agree. I have many friends who have part-time jobs. They often work around their university. In particular, they go to work after finishing their lessons. I do not have any experience of working a part-time job. Nevertheless, I believe that college students need to work, especially during school vacations for the following reasons. First, a part-time job offers students a lesson on the importance of money. They will get money through hard work. Therefore, they will spend less money and save more money. College students usually spend money drinking and enjoying time with friends, so they spend money easily. This lesson can save money from their wastefulness. Second, students receive a lot of money from their parents. Registration fees are very expensive, but many students' fees are paid by their parents. If students get money to cover their own expenses, parents will be appreciative. Accordingly, students need to make the money to use on their own. Finally, students get priceless experiences through a part-time job. After graduating from college, they will work at a company and experience many things at their company. If they have a part-time job, they obtain a new opportunity before their true job. They can learn about their key abilities and personality in advance. It is important for college students to have a part-time job.
