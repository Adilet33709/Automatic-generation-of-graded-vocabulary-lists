I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Today, because of health problems and high costs, more and more Japanese don't smoke. In Japan, many public places have made smoking illegal and many people hate smoking, so smokers have difficulty in living. If smokers have to stop smoking and don't know what to do, they have great difficulty in smoking at the restaurants. When smokers want to smoke a cigarette and they realize that smoking is forbidden, they are heavily disappointed. If smoking is banned at all restaurants, smokers won't make trouble at restaurants for people who don't smoke. I think the best way for Japan is to ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country. In doing so, smokers will learn that smoking is not good for other people. In college years, people don't judge smokers harshly if they smoke. But in society, people judge smokers harshly. For these reasons, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
