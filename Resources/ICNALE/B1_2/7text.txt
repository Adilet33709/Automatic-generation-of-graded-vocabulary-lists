Since humankind came into existence, Allah has provided everything, but when humans did not obey Allah’s orders, they paid for their deeds. Therefore, from that day, every human worked in different forms for his provisions. Some were successful and some are still trying hard to meet both ends. A part-time job is one of those kinds of work that people do for few hours to receive payment for their work and earn their provisions. Generally, part-time jobs are done to have that extra luxury in your life, which will make your life more tempting and attractive. However, sometimes they are done to ensure you can meet all the expenses at the end of the month, and in fewer cases, people do them as a hobby, turning their spare time into cash. As nothing is perfect in this world, the same is true with a part-time job. It has its good and bad parts. The good part is that you have a little bit of money in your hands in a short time, and you are not spending your time like a couch potato. However, high turnovers and no consistency in quality are a few of the bad parts to highlight.
