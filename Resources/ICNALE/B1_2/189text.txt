College students are at a level where they are sensible enough to understand what is best for them. They come to college with many aspirations and high aims and goals. They are students who want to touch the pinnacles of success, with strong wishes and aims. However, some students are diverted from their path for various reasons. In other words, they start doing part-time jobs and hence they suffer as a result. There are some hidden causes behind this. Firstly, the major reason that students do part-time jobs is that, as it is said, poverty is the causes of all ills and the waste of all crimes. Hence, just as necessity is the mother of inventions, these poor college students indulge in part-time jobs to fulfill the necessities of their lives; hence, their attention toward their studies is diverted, and they start getting lower grades in their studies, which is their main aim. To prevent the students from doing such part-time jobs and to show the precious futures of the young talent, poverty should be eradicated so that every individual grows up with a light of hope and prosperity.
