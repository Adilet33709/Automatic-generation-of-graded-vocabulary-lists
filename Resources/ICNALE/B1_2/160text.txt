I think that having a part-time job is very important during university life. First, work is a very precious experience. Part-time jobs in university life are almost always service jobs. So, through working in service, we can meet people of various fields and can talk with strangers. The first time I had a part-time job, I couldn't talk with other people because I had no confidence and was shy. Now I can talk perfectly to strangers. I think these experiences are a benefit of part time work. Next, students can learn the importance of money. Since I was a high school student, I have always lived with pocket money given to me by my parents and I didn't know it was hard to make money. After becoming 20, I have worked hard to earn about 5000-6000won per hour and now I think carefully when I spend money, even just drinking a cup of coffee or eating a spoonful of ice cream. During the five months that I have worked to earn money, I have had various part-time jobs, but I want to have more jobs and meet more people in various fields because I think it is a very valuable experience that I can get during part-time jobs and these experiences are so powerful. Therefore, I think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job.
