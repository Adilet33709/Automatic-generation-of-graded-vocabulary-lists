Personally, I do not agree with the statement that it is important for university students to have a part-time job. In my opinion, students should put their studies first because studying is the main responsibility of being a student. Students should be able to cope with their studies before making any other decisions. If they are unable to handle their studies, how will they be able to manage their time well? Another reason is the time consumed by a part-time job. I think this aspect relates to the types of part-time job. I had a classmate who had a part-time job at a pharmaceutical company. He usually worked for three to four full days a week, which I think is unacceptable. Therefore, I think it is less important for university students to have a part-time job while they are studying. However, some people might suggest that having a part-time job is important because some people need to earn their living. Some might also argue that it would be good opportunity to gain experience before working in the society because some companies require previous experience. However, I do not agree with this idea to some extent because a students’ responsibility and time should be spent on studying rather than a part-time job.
