I agree with this statement. At all of the restaurants I have ever been to there is no wall between smokers’ seats and non-smokers’ seats, so I want to explain about only this kind of restaurants. First of all, I want to explain about one reason. Recently in more and more restaurants, smoking has been completely banned in Japan, however there are still two kinds of seats, smoking and non-smoking, in some restaurants. I am not a smoker, so I will choose the non-smoking seats. But even if I sit in those seats, I often feel bad because of the flowing smell of smoke. The smell of the cigarette is very strong. That is why smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Secondly, I have heard that secondhand cigarette smoke is much worse than firsthand smoke. That means that smoking has a worse effect on non-smokers at a restaurant than smokers. I think it is unfair for non-smokers. I think smokers should smoke outside of a restaurant or in one smoker's room. It is fair and reasonable. Smoking is bad for your health. I am sure that we have to discuss good or bad points of smoking before thinking about banning smoking at restaurants. That is why I strongly believe that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants all over the world, not only in Japan.
