I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have many bases for my opinion. Most college students don't go to school near their homes; they live near the college. This requires lots of money. Naturally, this life imposes a heavy burden on their parents. We have a lot of time while we are at college. When we leave home, if you have a part-time job, you lessen the burden on your parents, and a part time job offers many experiences. You can work in many kinds of occupation through part-time jobs. You will meet many different people in various workplaces. I think that's the most important thing. A part-time job makes it possible to understand economic activities as you manage spending and income yourself. At first it is hard, but as time goes by you will feel that it's easy. It's practice for your future social life. I think a part time job has many advantages. You don't spend free time on other things when you have a part time job. I recommend working; do not study everyday all the time. It's a greater help than library life to you. It gives many things to you. It's hard to work, but it doesn't disappoint you; I'm confident in it.
