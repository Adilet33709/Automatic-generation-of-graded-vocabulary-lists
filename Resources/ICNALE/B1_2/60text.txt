Everything has a root cause. The root cause of smoking is often stress release, health problems, or the company of people that we have. However, with the passage of time, the use of smoking took different shapes. The main sources of smoking are cigarettes, cigars, hookahs and, nowadays, sheesha. People smoke for various reasons, some do it for fun, some for their health needs, and some smoke as a status symbol, but most do not know why they smoke. Releasing stress is one of the main things that a smoker will tell when you ask him about smoking. To put a thing or habit on a good or bad list depends upon its usage. If you smoke because your doctor has advised you that burning one or two cigarettes does not matter, and you are doing it for fun, to look cool, and to release stress, these are just ways to satisfy ourselves. In fact, smoking is a silent killer; passive smoking is more dangerous than active smoking. Smoking destroys your natural beauty and natural assets, and that day is not far when the clouds of fumes and the smell of nicotine become natural if you continue to smoke at the same pace.
