Smoking is a current issue in our country; it is a bad habit, which spreads very quickly. We found many people in our daily lives who smoke. They are badly addicted to it and smoke continuously. Not only elders, but also the majority of youngsters smokes cigarettes. Some smoke only to be fashionable, and others smoking by following their elders; when they see their elders are smoking, they have a desire to taste it. If they smoke by following their desire, they become badly addicted with the passing of time and then it becomes very difficult for them to stop. Smoking has negative effects on health. It not only affects the health of smokers, but it also has negative effects on non-smokers because the fumes of the cigarettes cause many diseases such as lung cancer, asthma, and even eye problems. Smoking badly pollutes the environment. The smoke of cigarettes is very dangerous for all people whether they smoke or not. It is medically proven that a smoker dies sooner than does a non-smoker. Because they inhale the smoke, non-smokers also suffer from various diseases, and they can succumb to lung cancer by breathing in a smoky environment. The smoke also affects our senses. It causes us to lose the sense of taste, so we cannot enjoy the real taste of food in a smoky environment. Because of all these effects, smoking should be banned in restaurants because people go there to have great meal in a good environment. Therefore, to provide a good environment to the customers, restaurants should be cleaned, and they should have a smoke free environment. By doing so, people will enjoy their meal and enjoy themselves with their friends and family members in a smoke free, fresh, and healthy environment. In conclusion, smoking should be strictly banned in restaurants.
