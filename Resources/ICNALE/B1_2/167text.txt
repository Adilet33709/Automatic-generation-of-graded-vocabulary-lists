I agree that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have two reasons. First of all, smokers are more likely to develop cancer. To human cancer, we are experiencing now 30-40 percent of all cancers being caused by tobacco. At least 20 kinds of cigarettes inside the Level A may contain carcinogens. The accumulation of carcinogens in tobacco smoke continuously for long periods, depending on the type of cancer, greatly increases the probability of occurrence of cancer. Currently we are experiencing, among all mankind, 30-40% of cancer being caused by cigarettes. Therefore, if the world did not smoke, 30-40% of all cancers would not have occurred. The second reason is another disease: smoking leads to respiratory diseases. If cigarette smoking continues, respiratory function continues to weaken. As a smoker continues to smoke cigarettes, bronchial wall thickening creates a narrowing of bronchus and weakens respiratory function. For these reasons, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
