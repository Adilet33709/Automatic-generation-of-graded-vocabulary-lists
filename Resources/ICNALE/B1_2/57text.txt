I agree. First, smoking can threaten the health. As a report states, a cigarette contains more than thousands of  different toxic or poisonous chemicals such as nicotine and carbon dioxide. These chemical ingredients threaten the health, especially that of the lungs. Smoking causes not only smokers but also non-smokers to die. According to a survey, more than 50,000 Americans die from second hand smoke (SHS) every year. Of those, thousands of American non-smokers die from lung cancer. Like this, not only smokers but also SHS could cause lung cancer. Therefore, smoking in public should be prohibited. Second, smoking can make public spaces, especially the university campus, unpleasant environments. A poisonous gas and the harmful content of e cigarettes can pollute the air of public spaces. The campus space must be a safe and pleasant environment for faculty, staff and students. Smoking on campus in public space plays a role in creating an unpleasant environment. According to a survey at Utah State University, about 80% of students would support a policy making the campus completely smoke-free. Smoke in the air pollutes the clean air of campus which is made by trees, and the students find this unpleasant. Smoking in public spaces, especially on campus, should be prohibited.
