At present, a lot of people have died because of smoking, and still some people are at risk of getting cancer. I agree with the statement that we should ban smoking in restaurants. In my opinion, nowadays smoking seems to be normal for most people. They like to smoke everywhere. Restaurants are places where families like to have dinner, have a nice time together, or some people use them for meetings. Therefore, this place has people of different ages such as children, teenagers, adults, and old people. If someone is smoking in a restaurant, it could affect the people who surround them. Imagine that how many people surrounding them will be second-hand smokers. It also affects smokers themselves. The atmosphere also is destroyed, and I think it is not fair that the other people didn't smoke but they get those bad effects from someone they don't know. We should do something to protect people from these effects and I agree with the proposed way and think that it will be better if all the restaurants have a rule that does not allow smoking there. When they start to do it, I think it will be a point that attracts people to come in.
