Smoking is a nuisance, which causes ethical and physical degradation of an individual and, in the long run, becomes a significant reason for the degeneration of a whole society. Man has been created by God Al Mighty in the highest level of perfection. The ills of smoking lure his status from the pinnacle to the abyss of degeneration, thus ruining his personality. Moreover, smoking should be abolished because it not only harms the one carrying out this atrocity but it also pollutes the environment and disturbs the beauty of the nature. Hence, smoking should be banned, keeping in mind its hazards, especially in restaurants. Restaurants are a public place, where people meet and enjoy different foods. A family place like this should not be polluted by smoking. Smoking causes an unusual and bad odor to spread in the whole area, which disturbs other people. Therefore, it can be comprehensively concluded that smoking is an evil that should be eradicated from the society. In addition, not only the society but also the individual should get away from this enemy and purify the society from this evil. In short, in the same way that not every shining thing is gold, smoking should be only seen as a malicious thing and hence effective measures should be taken to eradicate this from the grass roots.
