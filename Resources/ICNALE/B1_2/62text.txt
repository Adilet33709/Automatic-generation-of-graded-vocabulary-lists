Along with the rapid development of society, more and more problems are being brought to our attention, one of which is that our health is weaker than maybe 30 years ago, when our parents were teenagers. There are so many bad habits accounting for this issue. Smoking is one of these concerns, particularly smoking in public places. If people ask me whether we should ban smoking in public places, as far as I am concerned, I would agree that we should ban smoking in unsuitable situations, particularly in restaurants. Firstly, you are unconsciously harming the health of the people around you, no matter whether you are willing to or not. It is unfair for others to bear the bad effects of smoking. People come to have meals in restaurants; they don't come to get harmed by second-hand smoke. In the second place, it is considered impolite to smoke before many non-smokers. Gentlemen will never smoke before a lady and will speak ill of smoking. Last but not least, smoking is obviously breaking down your health, wherever you smoke, as cigarettes contain a variety of poisonous materials. Taking all of the above into account, we can easily draw the conclusion that banning smoking in public places is essential and that getting rid of smoking is also necessary. Thus, we should ban smoking completely in restaurants for both smokers’ and nonsmokers' health.
