I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. The basis for this is that the smoke produced by smokers has been proven to be hazardous to health and it can be a nuisance to restaurant-goers because smoking is a form of air pollution. First, scientific studies have proven that secondhand smoke - smoke produced from smoking - poses a bigger health threat than smoking itself because the smoke produced contains more carcinogens and unfiltered chemicals than what is inhaled by the smoker. Allowing smoking at restaurants would expose everyone, especially children and the elderly, to health risks. Most restaurants are air-conditioned, which makes it worse because there is no ventilation for the smoke produced and it is inevitable that restaurant-goers would have to inhale and deal with the smoke produced. Second, smoking is a form of air pollution and can disrupt restaurant goers enjoying their meal and company. Most restaurant goers would simply want to enjoy the ambience of the restaurant without having to deal with the unnecessary smoke or the unpleasant smell that smoking produces, unless they are smokers themselves. For the greater public good, smoking should be banned completely at all the restaurants in the country, as restaurants should be respected as public places equivalent to hospitals, schools, and airports, where a smoking ban has already been imposed. Also, it is not completely unreasonable to ban smoking completely at restaurants because there are other more suitable and appropriate areas for smokers to smoke.
