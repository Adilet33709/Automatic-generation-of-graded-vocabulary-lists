I think it is a good idea that smoking should be banned in all restaurants because we all know that cigarettes can cause liver disease, bad breath, and can weaken our ability to think. Cigarettes not only affect the user but also the people near them. This is because the smoke coming from the cigarette that is exhaled by the smoker disseminates through the air and is inhaled by nearby people. These people will inhale the second-hand smoke. Even though it is called “second-hand” its effects are greater than those for the smoker. It is really important to have a no smoking policies in all restaurants so that the cleanliness in the surrounds and in the air is maintained. It also garners good comments from people who go to the restaurants because smoking in an area makes the place feel like it is not a formal place. Restaurants have their own rules, and one of the most important rules is to serve customers well and to know the saying that “the customers is always right”. This means that every restaurant needs to be ready to meet the needs of every customer they may have. For example, if their customer is a smoker they have to talk with him/her kindly to inform them that they don't allow cigarettes in their restaurant, or to bring him/her to a place where there are no customers that may be affected so that no problems will occur.
