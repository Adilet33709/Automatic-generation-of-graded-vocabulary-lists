As we all know, smoking is a bad habit, which affects all people who do not smoke, so I agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants. Some people argue that smoking has several benefits, such as helping the body and mind relax, helping to concentrate on study or work, and some even say that smoking is legal, so people should respect the rights of smokers. However, those smokers always ignore the fact that the nasty smell of the smoke and the toxic substances released from the cigarettes are harmful to others. No matter what smokers argue, people around smokers are forced to breathe in secondhand smoke, which shows how selfish those smokers are. Reports from different medical research has already found that the smoke and toxic substances from cigarettes cause cancer, including lung cancer. Even if smokers are not concerned about the potential danger of having cancer, they should not ignore the rights of others who want to avoid those substances. Smoking in the kitchen can be even more dangerous. When people smoke, cigarette ash may drop onto the food being prepared, which is very harmful to our health. Secondly, without enough care, lighted cigarettes may cause a fire in the kitchen, which is a serious threat to customers in the restaurant. Therefore, I agree that smoking should be banned in restaurants because of the health issues it may cause.
