Having a part-time job is not easy because at the same time you are also a college student. If I am not mistaken, there are times that you forget the things you need to do as student like your assignments, reports, projects, and reviews etc. There is limited time if you are going to study at the same time working. There are also times when working students will lose interest in studying and would rather choose to work because, according to them, it is nice to earn money compared to studying the year long. It is really nice to be a working student because it has advantages, like earning money to be able to buy the things that you want, saving for the future, paying for expenses that you have, helping to pay your tuition fees, and increasing your self-esteem. It also helps you to build relevant skills and your ability to multi-task. Having a part-time job helps you to feel a sense of dignity and worth. In my own opinion, I think that part-time jobs are for students who are more competitive and very flexible in their work. Further, I find that it is more challenging for working students to compete in school activities. I think if you really want to help financially or to earn money, summer job opportunities are good because they are not hard and you can focus on what you’re doing. In my case I'd rather choose to study first than having a part time job to be able to excel more in my studies and to achieve academic excellence.
