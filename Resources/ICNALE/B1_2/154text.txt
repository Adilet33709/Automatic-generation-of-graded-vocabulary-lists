Nowadays many people hold a pessimistic attitude towards college students' behavior, specifically as it relates to having part-time jobs. For me, I think it is important for college students to have part-time jobs for several reasons. First and foremost, it is a perfect opportunity for experience-lacking college students to practice their knowledge. Part-time jobs open a new door for inexperienced students to encounter and learn to adapt to the complex society, which can broaden their horizons and strengthen their abilities. Secondly, taking up part-time jobs is also an approach to relaxing. As we know, all work and no play make Jack a dull boy. Getting along with various kinds of people and working in a group can bring a fresh feeling during part-time jobs. Last but not least, college students can also earn money via part-time jobs, which can help to support their lives and allow them to realize the hardship required to acquire every coin. As to those against part-time jobs, saying that they are a waste of time and have a bad impact on studying, I don't think they are right. As mentioned above, having part-time jobs is meaningful, as it not only strengthens students, but also makes them mature enough to set foot into society. As for studying, what is known to all is that appropriate practice contributes to studying by combining theory and practice. All in all, taking up part-time jobs should be encouraged among college students.
