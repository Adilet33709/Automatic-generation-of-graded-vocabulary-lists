I agree with a ban on smoking in all restaurants. Smoking is a bad habit that most Filipinos have. It causes various diseases, symptoms, and abnormalities in the human body for the very addicted. This is a good ban to propose as it may decrease the number of Filipino smokers in the country and will also clear the air and prevent unwanted passive smoking. The ban is a good way to limit the number of places to smoke so smokers may quit their very bad habit. Also, for those who do not like the smell of cigarettes, it will give them a haven and protect them from passively smoking. Nothing good ever comes out of smoking, even though some say it is very stress relieving. Of course, a lot of other people will disagree with this ban, so to prevent any miscommunication they should be given a place that is for smokers only. The decision of a person to smoke should not affect the welfare of others. Thus, in simpler and shorter terms, like a phrase I read from a post, "a smoker's poor choice should not affect the health and welfare of others."
