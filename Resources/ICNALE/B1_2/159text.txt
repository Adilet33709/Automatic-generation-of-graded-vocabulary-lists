There are pros and cons for applying for part-time jobs, and there are different kinds of jobs. The most popular part-time jobs are waiting tables in restaurants and junior technical support positions in computer shops. Some students apply for freelance jobs, which require advanced skill sets, such as taking photographs or writing computer programs. Without doubt, part-time jobs can be an opportunity for students to earn money. Some students from families with poor financial situations have to work after having lessons to support the family. Other benefits of applying for part-time jobs include making new friends at work to enlarge the student’s social network, learning to work with others, which students may not have done before, and learning new skills that may not be included in the university course syllabus. Of course, there are also cons for applying for part-time jobs. Without good time management, students may not be able to balance the time and effort they put into their studies and their part-time jobs, and this can have a huge effect on their grades. Choosing an appropriate type of part-time job is important too; otherwise, students might fall into traps setup by fraudulent companies. In conclusion, although university students have a good opportunity to apply for part-time jobs, their studies are most important; therefore, students should plan well before applying for any jobs.
