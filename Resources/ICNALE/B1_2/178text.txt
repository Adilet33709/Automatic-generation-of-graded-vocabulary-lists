It is important for college students to have a part-time job. It is important because sometimes they have more free time that can be spent doing a part time job. Not only can they spend free time in a good way but also it is one way to prepare for adult life, such as by dealing with many strange people, developing their personality, and learning how to take responsibility for what they have done. A part time job can train them how to earn money and let them know that it is not an easy thing to make money. Then they will use their money more and more carefully. Besides, I think that as a college student, if we want to buy something we really want, we should earn money by ourselves, not use the money of our parents. Using our own money, we will not feel guilty anymore, or if the kids can give the parents the money they earn, their parents will be very happy. Last, in my opinion a part time job is good for students who have more free time but it should not affect our studies.
