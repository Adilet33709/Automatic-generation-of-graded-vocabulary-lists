In my opinion, to get a part-time job to do in daily life is a good choice. Some students in universities want money for their education. Most of these students don't have enough money for learning, so part-time jobs help them waste less money. Some students want money for buying something they want. That's a good thing because it means they don't use their parent's money for things they prefer and that these things were meant for them. I can see that part-time jobs have many benefits. But on the other hand, there aren't many part-time jobs that are good. There are also jobs that are dangerous for students; especially, for girls. For example, some girls are waitresses in pubs. Of course, it's very dangerous for innocent girls. But these kinds of jobs can give them a lot of money fast. Even though they work in a restaurant, if you have bad friends, there are terrible things waiting for you. So many parents won't let their children have part-time jobs. But I think that everything has its own pros and cons, so it's up to anyone to choose. The most important thing, everybody should have their own thoughts and do anything you think is the best way. But don't forget to ask your parents and trust them because they know exactly the best thing for you.
