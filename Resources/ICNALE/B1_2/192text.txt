Yes, because students choose to have a part-time job to support their studies. Part-time jobs help us students pay our tuition fees and to meet other needs. They also teach us to be responsible because with a job we will know when to socialise, when to study, and when to do our work. Students need to have a part-time job because not all students are capable of going to school. Many parents are not able to support their child to go to school. This is one reason why some students have a part-time job, to help or support themselves in achieving their goals and dreams in life. Through a part-time job, students can practice what is being taught in their classes because they can use their knowledge in the school and apply it to the company or employer that they work for. It can also help students to get more experience for future jobs. This can help students to grow by themselves because those who do not do part-time jobs usually spend their parents’ money, while students who work to earn their money for themselves will know how difficult it is to gain money for school and for themselves.
