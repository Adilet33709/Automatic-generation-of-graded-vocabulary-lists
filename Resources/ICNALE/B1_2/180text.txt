I agree with this statement. I think having a part-time job is important for college students. I have 2 reasons. Firstly, thanks to part-time jobs, students can earn money by themselves. For ordinary families, college fees are very expensive. And if students are living alone, much money is needed. So by having part-time jobs, they can help their families. Moreover, even for students from rich families, earning money is important because by using that money they can do many things. For example, they can travel or study abroad. So, in this way, having a part-time job is beneficial for college students. Secondly, thanks to part-time jobs, students will have social experiences that they never learn in school. For example, in food stores or restaurants, they are taught manners and how to speak to customers politely. Such skills will be useful after they become working adults. Moreover, they can learn how hard working is. It is said that these days young people soon quit their jobs, but if they know about the reality of working before they graduate from college, they can persist even if their work is hard. Therefore, I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
