As a college student, it is important to have a part-time job because it has many benefits for them. The first benefit is that it can increase their work experience before they have a real job. Students need to know how to act in the workplace, what they must do, and how to use their abilities at work. And they need to know too how to talk with the boss, what they need to do to earn a raise, and learn socialism at their workplace. The second benefit is to help their parents with their school funds. Having a part-time job can help students decrease their parents works, or increase their monthly income. It is useful for poor families that have a low monthly income. The third benefit is that it can help a student prepare for when they have a real job, so they will not be surprised when they feel something different from working; the level of difficulties between real life in the workplace and college life is really different. At college, we only get frustrated from the homework or things related to studying, but at work we can get frustrated by our boss, our rivals, or even our friends.
