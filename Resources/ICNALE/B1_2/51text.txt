I agree with this statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have two reasons. The first, is that many college students don't have money but they need a lot of money for their food, clothing and shelter, playing with theirs friends, going anywhere and buying anything that they want. Yet, when they use their money to buy something, theirs parents don't always give some money to them. So they need to have a part-time job. By the working they can get some money, also experience selling products and services and learn the difficulties in earning money. This is the first reason. The second reason is that the wages for college students are cheaper than other workers. So if college students work part time, many companies and shops can hire them without paying higher wages to employees.  Now the condition of business is very bad in Japan. Some people think that because college students work part-time, many unemployed people miss their opportunities to work and so the unemployment rate is high. Certainly the population of the workforce does contain a number of college students and the part-time work done by college students causes the rise in the unemployment rate. Yet it is said that business in the world is the worst for a hundred year so when business gets good the unemployed people now will be able to get work and the unemployed people will be fewer than now. By college students working part-time, many companies and shops can decreased the payment of employees wage. So I agree with the statement.
