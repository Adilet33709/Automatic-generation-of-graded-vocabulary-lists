A part-time job is a very useful source of income for students. They can take their class in the morning and do a part-time job in the evening or at night. People come to know the importance of money when they become adults. They have to earn money to run their homes or relieve their parents of some of the pressure of earning money and take them to a level that now they can. When they are able to do something, some people choose to teach classes and some people opt to work at a call center but their aim is to decrease their dependence on their parents or caretakers and fulfill their desires. However, some people who get a part-time job stop caring about their studies. They try to earn as much as they can, giving their study less importance and working long hours, which affects their health. There is also a tendency for those living in hostels to get a part-time job to support their studies because some of them are not financially supported and they have to pay their tuition fees. The government should provide scholarships for deserving students so that they can study and get high grades.
