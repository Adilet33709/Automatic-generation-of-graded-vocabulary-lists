Part-time jobs for college students depends on the person's point of view. In some countries, part-time jobs are considered a form of learning to merge with society, learn about the working environment, and gain new experiences. Indonesian people have many different opinions about part-time jobs. Some think that part-time jobs are not necessary and students should focus on their college work. They think that the experience of working can be learned later after their education is finished. Some parents think that working can disturb the learning process of their children, while others think that working can make their children unwillingly continue their study as they will prefer working to learning. I have two different points of view. Firstly, I agree that working can be used as the media of learning for society. Students will be able to see and understand many new conditions, levels of work, and increase their funds. By receiving a salary from working, students can help their parents indirectly because they can use their salary for their daily needs. But working is not recommended for students who are already too busy with assignments and activities. Some colleges force students to study by giving them a lot of tasks. Some students get into the organization of extracurricular activities such as sports. If they are already busy with their work, it will become a burden for the students to work at a part-time job. I conclude that part-time work can be effective for certain people.
