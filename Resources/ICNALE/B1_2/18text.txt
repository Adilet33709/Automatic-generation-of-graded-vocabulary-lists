Many students think that having a part-time job is important for them since they can get experiences of working and earning money. In my opinion, it is not important for university students to have a part-time job because it is less important than getting a good academic result and joining in different school activities. There are three main reasons for my opinion. First, as university is already the last three years of studying in the whole of our lives, we should study well while joining in different school activities. It is time-consuming for us to have a part-time job. Second, work experiences can be obtained after we have finished our university studies. There is much time left after the end of our studies. Third, it is not necessary to get a part-time job. Between scholarships and support from our parents, students should have enough cash to live on without having a part-time job to earn extra money. In conclusion, I think that we should treasure the remaining time we have of our studies and enjoy the chances we have to make new friends. Therefore, I disagree that it is important for university students to have a part-time job.
