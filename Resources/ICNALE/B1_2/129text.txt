Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. ??? In my opinion, I believe that smoking should be completely banned. Not only is smoking any form of tobacco dangerous to your health, but it is also bad for the health of those around you. Smoking should be banned at restaurants and all public areas. Smoking negatively affects our society through environmental problems, economic problems, health risks to others, and especially health problems it causes in children. There is no reason to smoke cigarettes, and doing so does not benefit anyone in any way. Smoking in public is the same as driving drunk because both endanger the lives of innocent people who choose not to engage in the reckless behavior. The only difference is that with smoking, the effects are not visible immediately because it has long-term effects. Banning smoking in public will ultimately increase the quality of life and in turn will better society as a whole. Therefore, I agree that completely smoke-free places are the ideal, and some businesses have taken the decision to go completely smoke-free. However, everyone agrees that it is a matter of rights - the right of smokers to smoke versus non-smokers to be protected from passive smoking and to breathe clean air.
