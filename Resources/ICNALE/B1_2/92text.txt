Everyone must know that smoking is very dangerous. It has had many bad effects on smokers and people around them. Smoking can give both active and passive smokers many diseases. It can cause cancer and many other health problems. Smoking inside a room is very dangerous for passive smokers. Usually, passive smokers have to cover their noses or leave the room as fast as possible. But, in some places like a restaurant, we can't get out when there are people smoking near us. We usually eat in a restaurant for a long time. If people near us are smoking, it spreads the smoke to many people. Smoke that is produced from cigarettes is very dangerous for our health. If we inhale it over a long period, we could get serious health problems. People should think about others. They shouldn't smoke in front of others because it could give both active smokers and passive smokers many diseases. It can cause cancer and many other health problems. If they can't stop smoking in front others, I think restaurants should ban smoking for the sake of all people. Smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country so that people who eat in the restaurants can eat calmly.
