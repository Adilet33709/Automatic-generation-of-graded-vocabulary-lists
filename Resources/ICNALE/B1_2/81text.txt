Most smokers still smoke, even though they know it is bad for their health. Unfortunately, it is not only the active smokers but also the passive smokers who receive the negative effects of smoking. This is the main reason why smoking should be banned at all restaurants. Both active and passive smokers share the same deathly risks, including stroke, heart disease, brain damage, and cancer. These passive smokers would be saved from these deadly issues if people were not allowed to smoke in restaurants. Inhaling the smoke can disrupt the human respiratory system, and smokers give bad impressions. Their teeth are stained, their gums are rotted, and they give off unpleasant odors. These conditions are uncomfortable for non-smokers. As an example, a non-smoker like me would prefer to eat in the non-smoking section of a restaurant because the non-smoking sections are usually cleaner than the smoking sections. The smoking section contains smokers and tobaccos ash, which would cause me discomfort. It would be better to ban smoking completely at all restaurants rather than increase the number of smoking and non-smoking sections. Since there are many passive smokers at all restaurants, smoking should be banned.
