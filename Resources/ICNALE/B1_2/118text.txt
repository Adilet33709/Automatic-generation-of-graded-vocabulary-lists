Smoking causes harm to smokers themselves and also harms those around them. Smoking releases many toxins and it also causes cancer. People may face many smokers who smoke in public places. However, for us, to smoke in restaurants is not to be made very much of, because the restaurant offers many services to people both young and old who don't smoke. They separate smoking areas and non-smoking areas. For anyone who wants to smoke, they will respect the rules by going outside so people sitting in the restaurant don't get any smells from the cigarettes. Restaurants are for having fun and relaxing, it doesn't need to ban smokers. In coffee shops, many people love drinking coffee and smoking. I think it is personal taste, so if we still produce and sell cigarettes, why do we have to ban them? To ban smoking is not the solution. If people don't want to see anyone smoke, we should stop producing and selling cigarettes. Smoking should not be banned, but we should just have two different areas for customers, for smokers and for non-smokers. Thus, everyone is happy because each side has their own place. Smokers got their place to smoke, non-smokers got their place to enjoy eating, and the owner of the restaurant is happy because they don't lose any customers.
