Yes, smoking is bad for your health but only if you do it regularly or you smoke one pack a day or more. If you smoke like one cigarette per day or just when you are stressed from work it is okay. Banning smoking in restaurants across the country appears to be somewhat unfair to some. There are smoking lounges in some restaurants and these are a better way to solve this problem. There should be a separate area for smokers and non-smokers. In this way, non-smokers won't be affected or be second-hand smokers. Banning won't be the solution to the problem of smoking. Do you really expect that people will completely follow that regulation? I don't think so, unless there are heavy consequence. This still depends on the respect and responsiveness of the people around you. In our country, I don't really see people smoking inside restaurants. I do see people smoking outside air-conditioned places, but I haven't seen anyone smoking inside the mall or wherever they want. Maybe smoking can be banned in restaurants that don't have smoking areas, this would be the best. We must also take into consideration those who already gone to the effort of creating smoking areas.
