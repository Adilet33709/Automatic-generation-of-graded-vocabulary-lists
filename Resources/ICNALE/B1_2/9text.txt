In many countries, smoking is banned in supermarkets, restaurants, hospitals, airplanes, and most forms of public transportation. I'm against all of this. In university, there are so many more smokers than non-smokers. In other words, I disagree with idea of prohibiting smoking in public. So, in my opinion, we don't have to quit smoking. Cigarettes are the smoker's favorite food, just like how someone enjoys the favorite tea or coffee. Just show consideration for non-smokers. For example, smokers should smoke in limited areas. This is common sense. We don't have to quit smoking. But you can get a bad effect to it. First of all, it is dangerous to one's health, and can lead to cancer or other diseases. Second, it can be addictive. And third, it causes the body to smell bad, so many people will keep far away from a smoker. And fourth, there will be much money spent, and it is terribly big amount if it was accumulated. Thus, it is unfair to prohibit smoking in public. If smoking in public is prohibited, the smokers' rights to smoke are ignored. Making a smoking area in public is the best way to respect both smokers and non-smokers. Then, you'd better release to smoke than to quit. Thus, I don't agree with banning smoking.
