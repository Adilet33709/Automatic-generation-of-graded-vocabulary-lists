As we all know, smoking is bad for health, and even if that fact is shown in many advertisements, campaigns, and even on cigarettes boxes, not many people are paying attention. In fact, it is becoming more and more popular. The government has set up smoking areas in certain locations, and certain restaurants also provide a smoking area for their customers so that they will be able to smoke and at the same time contribute to the restaurant’s sales. Therefore, it does not just benefit the smokers by being convenient, but it also helps restaurants. Smoking is a bad habit of humanity, and it does not just hurt the smoker themselves but also the surrounding people who might end up breathing secondhand smoke. Smoking should be banned in all restaurants because if restaurants provide smoking area services, it will tend to attract more smokers to their restaurant. This hurts themselves and also the public who might breathe the secondhand smoke. Over time, smokers tend to depend on smoking even more, and non-smokers might get influenced and join them, and it will become a serious problem in the near future. In conclusion, taking everything into consideration, smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country.
