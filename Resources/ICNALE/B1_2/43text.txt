In high school, most students don't do a part-time job. I think that's because some of the students who were doing a part-time job still couldn't manage their time effectively. In fact, their scores were decreasing because of it. We are students whose first priority is studying. If a part-time job has a bad effect on our scores, I think it is better to stop doing the part-time job. But now we are college students, we have to manage our time wisely, and we should consider that doing a part-time job can give us many advantages. With a part-time job, we can help our parents earn money. And, instead of collecting money, we can get wonderful experiences from doing a part-time job. Experiences can help us do many things and make a conclusion. Experience is required when searching for a real job. Nowadays, there are many college students that do part-time jobs while studying at college and they do well in college and in their part-time job. If we could do them both, we shouldn't hesitate to do both college and a part-time job. It really gives us the precious experience that we need. It is important for college students to have a part-time job.
