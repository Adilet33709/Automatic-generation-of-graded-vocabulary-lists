One day, you go to a restaurant. You order food for your meal. After that, the waiter serves your food on the table. After you eat for a while, you smell something bad. It is the smell of smoke. How do you feel about it? When you have a meal in a restaurant, if you smell a bad thing, you will not like it. I think that the smell of smoke is one of the smells that needs to be completely banned in restaurants because when someone is smoking, the smell will annoy everybody around them and it also causes lung cancer in everybody. There must be a forceful law about smoking in restaurants, such as a penalty if you smoke in a restaurant area or being sent to jail. There is another way to fix the problem of smoking in restaurant areas. If a restaurant allows smoking in its area, it must have a special room for smoking so the smell will not annoy everybody anymore. There are lots of ways to fix the smoking in restaurants problem but I think the best way to fix this problem is to teach good morals to babies and tell them smoking is a bad thing, or the government must create a new law banning smoking, not just in restaurants but everywhere. That will make the country better.
