I think getting a part-time job while studying depends on the person. If he or she wants to earn money or get more experience, I think it should be okay. But, when we are really busy, have no time, and get easily tired, it is not the better choice. Getting a part-time job has a negative and positive sides. On the positive side, you can get more money for helping your parents, increase your income, get more experience, get more friends, be more independent, and take care yourself, so you can be more mature. On the negative side, you can get easily tired, spend a lot of time working, and have less time to study. If you want to get a good mark, I think you should think twice about taking a part-time job. Even if we can manage our time and maintain all of this, we should think twice about the effect on our body's health, because taking a part-time job is pretty difficult when you can't manage it well. If I must choose, I will not get a part-time job because it is difficult from me to manage my time, and actually I am easily tired. Despite not having any goals in my major (accounting) except getting a good final exam mark, I just do all of this as usual. Taking a part-time job like this just takes my time and puts myself at risk, so I absolutely refuse to do a part-time job.
