Smoking is a bad habit, but it shouldn't be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Many people may question and doubt why, but the reason is obvious. Of course smoking is harmful for health, and it also affects others' health; however, if we advocate no smoking in all restaurants in the country, what would the chain-smokers do? Chain smokers have made it a rule to smoke, so it's hard to ask them to quit smoking in a short time. So, if all the restaurants ban smoking, it may result in a wave of anger. Besides, the measure seems so extreme that many smokers may choose not to eat out. What will happen in the end? Some restaurants are likely to break the rules to attract customers and make money. In my opinion, restaurants should set up a smoking area or smoking rooms instead of banning smoking. The action doesn't encourage people to smoke; it just offers some room for smokers to relax temporarily. A chain-smoker will be unhappy if they cannot smoke, and who wants to see somebody with a long face when enjoying a meal at a restaurant? In conclusion, setting up smoking areas is better than banning smoking at all the restaurants, as it is a better policy that can bring reciprocal benefits for all the restaurants, customers, and smokers.
