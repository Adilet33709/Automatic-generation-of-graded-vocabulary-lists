Recently, more Thai people are becoming smokers than in the past, so there is a polluted atmosphere everywhere. That is the worst thing for traditional teenagers. Smoking is a cause of cancer and harms the smoker and people around them. There are many disadvantages about smoking cigarettes. For example bad smell, black teeth and gums, and addiction. In my opinion smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants, and not only restaurants but also schools, hospitals, parks, or public places. Although, in my opinion, this is the best way to make a good environment and save smokers' health and others around them while having a meal in a restaurant, it is also bad for the smokers, so we should have some area or place for smoking like the smoking areas in the airport. Because not all people are smokers, I think the owner of the restaurants should declare an area for smoking or make specific types of restaurants for their customers. I think smoking is bad for you and your family. No smoking is the best thing to do. For the smokers, when you want to smoke, maybe think about the others around yourself and mind your manners so no one will argue with you.
