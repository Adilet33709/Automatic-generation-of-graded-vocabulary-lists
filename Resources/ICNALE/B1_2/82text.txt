I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. And the rule should be done strictly. Why? First, cigarettes are harmful to our body. According to reports, smokers have higher chance of getting cancer and other diseases. And the people who do not smoke but breathe second-hand smoke also have a higher chance of damaging their lungs. As most restaurants are indoors, the air is closed in and not fresh. And if somebody is smoking, all the people in the restaurant will smell it. In my experience, I hate the smell of smoke, every time I smell the smoky air in a restaurant, I have a bad feeling, and I don't want to eat anymore because the food is also not clean. So I think it's better to have a law not to smoke in restaurants. Some restaurants are divided into two parts, smoking and non-smoking areas. But I think it's not a good idea, because we can still smell the bad air. So, I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
