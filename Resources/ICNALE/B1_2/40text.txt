I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are two reasons: health problems and manners. First, smoking causes health problems. Smoking isn't good not only for a smoker's health but also for other people's health. If a smoker has disease like cancer in his lungs because of smoking, it is his responsibility. However, if a person who doesn't smoke develops lung cancer, he will want to find out why this happened. Of course, we can't know that all lung disease is caused by smokers, but there is possibility to develop lung disease in the future when someone smokes at a restaurant. Second, it is a matter of manners not to smoke in public spaces in today's Japan. Smoking makes a lot of people feel bad, so not smoking in public spaces is good manners. But, do we have to ban smoking? There is a good example. You will not do your makeup in a train because it is bad manners and it makes many people feel bad. But some people do makeup in a train even though they know it is bad manners. It is same as smoking. If we don't ban smoking clearly, some people will smoke at a restaurant in spite of knowing that many people hate it. For these two reasons, I think that smoking has to be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
