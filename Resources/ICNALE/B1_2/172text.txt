Part-time jobs are the jobs or work that people do besides their daily work routine and life. If a student goes to school, college, or university in morning and does something to earn money in the evening, he is doing a part-time job. If an employee works in an organization in the morning and does work somewhere else in the evening, he is doing a part-time job. Now the question is why are people doing part-time jobs? A major reason is that they want to make money to earn their living. Currently, the inflation rate is increasing day by day, and it has become impossible even for the head of an upper middle class family to maintain their status and keep their lives going smoothly, so they do part-time jobs. Students also do part-time jobs to help their families, make their own pocket money, or for experience, exposure, and independence. It gives them glimpses of the practical world. Regarding the payment of part-time jobs, it is not very satisfactory. Some mills and organizations pay very fairly. For example, Interloop, a knitting industry, pays their workers if they stay in mills after five o’clock to complete their work. However, some organizations cruelly exploit their employees. To conclude, part-time jobs are a current need. One must fulfill one's needs with one's own efforts because working for ourselves is far better than begging from others.
