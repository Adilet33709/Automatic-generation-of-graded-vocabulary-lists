Most university students do part-time jobs because they want to earn money so they can afford to pay for entertainment, buy fashionable clothes, and hang around with their new university friends. Most people think that those students focus solely on earning money and expanding their social scope, rather than their university studies. Whether it is important for a university student to get a part-time job depends on what he or she wants to get from it. University students are already adults. They should have the ability to determine the importance of having a part-time job. For me, it is important because I would like to get more work experience during my university life to prepare me for adapting to society after I graduate university. However, I will always put my studies before my part-time jobs since the main purpose for me to be a university student is to receive further education in my major and achieve all-round development. It is definitely shortsighted of students to focus solely on earning money and leave their studies and school life behind.
