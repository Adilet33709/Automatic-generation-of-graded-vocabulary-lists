Nowadays, some people smoke as a method release stress, but I strongly oppose smoking for several reasons presented as follows. First of all, in terms of health, smoking is very bad for the body. In fact, research nowadays reports that cigarettes contain nicotine and tar, which is proved to be very harmful to human health. According to studies, smoking leads to a higher chance of suffering from lung cancer, laryngo-carcinoma, and oral cavity cancer and so on. What is more, it is not only smokers themselves but also nonsmokers that are harmed by cigarettes. That is, experts believe that secondhand smoke does much more damage to people. Besides, they say that a secondhand smoker smokes six cigarettes while a smoker is smoking only one cigarette. Therefore, stopping smoking is not simply for smokers themselves but also for others around them. Last but not least, smoking builds a negative appearance of a smoker. Most people don't like the smell of cigarettes. Therefore, many people believe that the action of smoking would make them obscene and disliked by others. As a result, we should try our best to prevent people from smoking.
