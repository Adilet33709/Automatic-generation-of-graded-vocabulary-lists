We all know that smoking is not good for our health. There are a lot of effects from smoking, like it can cause lung cancer and sometimes death in the person who is smoking. Not only are smokers affected, but also the people who are inhaling the smoke. According to other people, people that inhale smoke are more affected than smokers. It is really disappointing that at the age of 13 people may already know how to smoke. Sometimes they are influenced by their friends or they see other people doing it, so government made a rule that no one should sell cigarettes to minors. Yet, this is not happening because there are still people selling cigarettes to minors. When the government learned that some people are still selling cigarettes to minors, they decided that those who do not follow this rule will punished. For today's generation, the government decided that there will be specific places where people can smoke. However, when I am asked about this problem I believe that smoking should be banned at all restaurant, and not only in restaurants but also in public places for our own good.
