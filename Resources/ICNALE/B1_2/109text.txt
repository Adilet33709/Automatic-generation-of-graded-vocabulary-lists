Smoking is one of the worst habits in the world, but there are still so many people smoking everywhere. So should smoking be banned at all restaurants in the country? The answer is positive. A cigarette includes a lot of harmful materials. As you know, it's pernicious for our health. Smoking negatively influences not only the person who smokes, but also the other person who smells the smoke. If plenty of people smoke in public places, human beings' health will be harmed, even if they haven't smoked ever. After all, it is unfair to let somebody smoke anywhere around them and destroy their bodies. Of course, restaurants are the places where we can enjoy our life. We should eat food with happy feelings. A cigarette can attract your attention, and then you will forget what you are enjoying. It's a bad habit that disrespects nature. We'd better be grateful for the entire world. Besides, smoking in restaurants easily causes fire accidents. People often forget to put out the cigarette, which causes the accidents. Out of the many things that the above has shown us, the most important thing is that a lot of people can die in fires. The sad experience warns us to be careful with smoking. In other words, smoking leads to too many unhappy things, and so it should be banned at all restaurants in the country.
