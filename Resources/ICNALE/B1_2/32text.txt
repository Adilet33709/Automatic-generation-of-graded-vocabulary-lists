I am 100 percent with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking in restaurants can not only give rise to unpleasantness, but also cause harm to other guests' health. As the air circulation is not good in a restaurant, the smell of smoke will probably affect other people. This little activity may completely ruin a dinner; how can you do that! On the other hand, there is no need for me to throw light on the harm of second-hand smoking because everybody knows it! Guests should not smoke in a restaurant, and neither should the cooks and the waiters, because the ash and smoke could directly get into the food and then get eaten by the customers. Meanwhile, smoking being banned does not mean that you could not smoke during a meal. If you cannot afford to live without a cigarette at the moment, it is OK for you to smoke outside. Maybe it is a little inconvenient, but for other people's sakes, do not complain! For the two reasons mentioned above, and the fact that you can still smoke outside the restaurant during a meal, put your hands up to show that you are with me! Smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country.
