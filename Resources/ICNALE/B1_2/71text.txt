According to medical research, smoking has a wide variety of adverse effects on human health. For example, it causes the number one fatal disease, lung cancer. It also leads to a high incidence rate of heart diseases. Thus, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. To begin with, everyone has the freedom to choose. Nicotine and tar in the cigarettes may cause serious health problems, which may in turn affect people’s efficiency. Non-smokers are innocent, and they should not be subjected to secondhand smoke, because they have the right to choose not to suffer from the fatal diseases; some are even allergic to the particulates. Considering the space of restaurants, the ventilation system is usually not good enough to get rid of all those particulates or main ingredients in cigarettes, so these substances are free to flow around, and others are forced to inhale the evil gas. As I have mentioned, there are plenty of outdoor areas for the smokers to choose, but if they invade the indoor areas, others have no place to escape the smoke. Smoking has serious effects on others’ health, so it should be banned completely at all restaurants.
