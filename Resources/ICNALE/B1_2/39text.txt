Part-time jobs can help you financially, especially when you're in college. College tuition fees vary by course, and of course, the school you are going to study at. If the university you are going to study at is well-known and has good standards it is more expensive. Though there are universities that offer scholarships, these are just for a few chosen students who can commit to it. Some public schools offer lower tuition fees but you still have to pay them. Having a part-time job can help you, especially when you apply to a job that has a decent salary. Yet, as a student, I doubt you're going to find a job that offers a lot of money. Studying while working can cause you difficulties relating to your time and schedule. You must either sacrifice time for your studies or your job. Working isn't really needed in college when you still have your parents to support you. This doesn't mean that you'll let them pay until you have children. You'll just have to pay them back by doing little things for them like washing the dishes etc., especially when your grades are high. Your parents will really appreciate it; they won't regret giving you the money to study at a prestigious university. So for me, a part-time job isn't really needed unless you're family needs the money and you have to sacrifice a little bit of time from studying to work. You must be determined to do both at the same time.
