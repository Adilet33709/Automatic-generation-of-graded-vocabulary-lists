In Indonesia, smoking is not forbidden for most people and in most places. People can smoke wherever they want in public. But certain places, such as malls, restaurants, hospitals, and schools forbid people to smoke. In my opinion, smoking in public places should be prohibited because of the disturbance it causes to others. Research says that passive smokers are 80% more likely to suffer from cancer than active smokers. After knowing that fact, people start to think about how to overcome this kind of problem. For example, shopping centers usually provide smoking areas for smokers. Hospitals strictly forbid smoking inside the hospital because it can create an unsuitable environment and cause more bacteria and viruses. Next, I will talk about smoking in restaurants. I will divide the restaurants into three levels: small-scale, mid-scale, and large-scale restaurants. Small-scale restaurants usually allow customers to smoke inside the restaurant. They don't separate places for smokers and nonsmokers. Mid-scale restaurants such as KFC, Pizza Hut, and McDonalds sometimes provide a smoking area for customers. For example, they provide outdoor seats for customers who smoke. In this scale, usually after the customers enter the restaurant, they will be asked whether they smoke or not and they will be directed to the smoking area if they smoke. Large-scale restaurants usually already forbid people from smoking. They don't have smoking areas to prevent disturbance to other customers.
