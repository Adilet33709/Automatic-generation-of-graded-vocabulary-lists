A lot of people smoke cigarettes everywhere to reduce stress. Of course, it seems to relieve their mind to smoke cigarettes. However, I disagree that smokers may smoke in public places as well as the entire restaurant. I think that smoking should be completely banned at public place in this country. There are some reasons supporting my idea. First, passive smokers are more likely to get cancer compared with non-smokers and smokers. According to a WHO report, passive smokers are always exposed to fatal disease like cancer and they are at risk of getting cancer three times to four times compared with non-smokers and smokers. Second, to smoke cigarettes costs a lot of social expense. The survey of the Ministry of Health and Welfare shows that smoking areas are the most expensive to clean because of time and employees. Third, smoking can cause dangerous accidents like fires. According to the National Emergency Management Agency, fires in restaurants have been caused by carelessly thrown away cigarette butts. As a result, many people are injured by this situation. For these reasons, I absolutely assert that smoking should be banned all places except smoking areas in the country.
