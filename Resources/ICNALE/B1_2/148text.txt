Without doubt, smoking should be banned in all restaurants because smoking is a selfish behavior, which definitely affects others and is annoying. When nonsmokers are forced to breathe in secondhand smoke, it is unfair because it affects non-smokers’ health. People who visit restaurants want to enjoy their meal, not others’ secondhand smoke. In addition, we need to consider the rights of the restaurant workers. Their job is to serve people, not inhale secondhand smoke. Their health will deteriorate if the smoking ban is not applied because they need to work there all day. The concentration of inhaled smoke is a thousand times that of the smoke inhaled by the smoker. Therefore, smokers need to stop and be more considerate. Moreover, smoke particles will stick on the food, which makes food poisonous because the smoke particles are carcinogenic, and it worsens the quality and appearance of the food. When you pay for your meal but it ruins your health, is it worth it? Some people argue that we can set up a smoking zone, but we should not forget that smoke particles can be diffused from a high concentration to a low concentration. It is no use of setting a smoking zone. It is only deceives people, so I agree.
