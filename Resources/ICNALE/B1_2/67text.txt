Yes, it is important to have a part-time job. A lot of people think that working while one is studying is tough work, and that one's studies necessarily suffer. However, in my opinion I feel that having a part-time job enriches one's life, not just in material terms, but in non-material terms. One can take away life's lessons, such as diligence, patience, team work, and social skills. This benefits the person for the entirety of their life, and so it is always better to start early. College students are at the point in their lives where they are the most malleable in terms of their psychological outlook, so having them learn some life lessons will definitely benefit them for the rest of their lives. The students also receive monetary benefits, which are always welcome, because tuition fees are always escalating, as is the cost of living and one's financial responsibility to support aging parents. Therefore, it is imperative that students, wherever possible and if they are physically able, to contribute to the household income by working part-time. Students can also learn more skills on the job, and gain valuable contacts that can put them in good stead for future job hires. In my opinion, some are born with a silver spoon, and will never work part-time. These are people who will never gain an appreciation for life.
