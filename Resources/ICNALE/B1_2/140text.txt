Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I agree with this topic in that smoking at all the restaurants should be banned. Smoking in public place should be banned too. For example, at parks, bus stops, universities, hotels, etc., because smoking makes many problems for the population. The restaurants have many people. Smoke is smelly, and when smokers smoke at restaurants, it disturbs other people. Furthermore, it becomes air-pollution. Smokers should not smoke at restaurants or public places. No one likes smoke so that smoker must have manners with other people. Some restaurants or public places have a smoking place, so smokers must smoke at this place. People can ban smokers who don't have manners because smoke can give the lungs cancer and smokers should take care of other people. Moreover, smoking can make danger at restaurants because restaurants have many gases, and when a smoker is smoking a spark of fire can make danger. Banning it can decrease smokers because smokers cannot smoke in public places. It makes them feel it is hard to smoke. If people do not ban bad smokers in the future, smoking may increase and it can become a simple behavior for smokers. Therefore, if smokers don't have manners, other people should completely ban them.
