It is important for college students to have a part-time job. Nowadays many college students have a part-time job. Some students do it for the experience, to make money, or for fun. But I think part-time job not good for all college students, it good for some students only. Because if college students do a part-time job it will have effect their study and they don't have time to read or practice their learning. Some students cannot arrange their time and get bad grades. They should not do a part-time job. But if they want to do it they will wait for the right time; for example, summer holiday or in their free time. They should keep time for study and read book. Moreover, part-time jobs have good points also. The students can make money by themselves. And they can help their parents and save money for their family. When they need something they can buy it by themselves and they don't have to disturb their parents. Whatever the part-time jobs are not important for college students because students must learn and grow up. Jobs will make students grow over as they age. If college students have problems with money to study then they can request scholarships. Today there are many scholarships for poor and good students. I think scholarships are better than college students to have a part-time job.
