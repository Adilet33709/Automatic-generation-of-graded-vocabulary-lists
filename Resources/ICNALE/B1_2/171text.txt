I agree with the idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I want to explain the two reasons why I think that college students should have a part time job. The first reason is that college students should really know the value and difficulties of getting money. People need money to live. A lot of money is needed for one person to be self-sufficient. Basically, college students depend on their parents, especially for money. But most students don't know how hard their parents work to earn enough money for their children. I think they should know how hard work is needed to get just a little money through a part-time job, as their parents have learned. The second reason is that college students can learn about social interaction through part-time jobs. Common sense as an employee is really essential for business, for instance, how to communicate with other people in business and how to talk. A part time job could be only one place that students can learn about society as working adults. Student can communicate with colleagues in their part time job to learn these skills. For these two reasons, I agree with the idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
