These days, many college students tend to stay at home without having part-time jobs because of self-improvement. Of course, this behavior gives them a lot of time that they can spend on self-improvement. However, I agree that college students should have part-time jobs. There are some reasons why I agree with this idea. First, college students can keep the spirit of independence. For example, they endure hard work for a month to earn money. These processes encourage them and foster their independence. In addition, the survey of the student council shows that students who experience part-time jobs have independence about four times higher than students who didn't experience part-time jobs. Second, college students are able to pay their school expenses. According to a civic organization's survey, seventy percent of college students pay their registration fees in installments with the money they earn for themselves during vacations. Third, to have a part-time job can make college students very organized and offer useful skills. It is reported that employees who experience part-time jobs quickly adjust to new environments compared with employees who didn't experience part-time jobs. In addition, college students who have part-time jobs can obtain skills that help them find a job. For these reasons, I strongly agree that college students should have part-time jobs: their spirit of independence, school expenses, and adaptability.
