I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because smoking has a lot of bad effects. Smoking is bad and extremely dangerous for our health. People usually go to restaurants for food not for smoking; they want healthy food not bad food. Smoking should perhaps be banned not only in restaurants but also in public places. Many people feel disturbed when they are eating by smell of the smoke because they can't smell the food. Smoking should be completely banned because there is no benefit from smoking, it is only bad for our health; there is no gain from smoking, only pain. Secondhand (passive smoker) smoke is more dangerous than filtered smoke so it is detrimental to people around smokers. Many people have suffered because of cigarette smoke; there are people with severely damaged lungs and hearts because of smoking and passive smoking. Small children are vulnerable to cigarette smoke, which is bad for their growth, health, lungs, and heart. Smoking causes a lot of harm to people, especially when they are eating, because an article I read said that when we are eating, we also inhale the smoke.
