Smoking is a bad habit that is dangerous for your health and people close by. People start smoking for a variety of different reasons. Some think it looks cool. Others start because their family members or friends smoke. Most adults who started smoking in their teens never expected to become addicted. I strongly disagree with smoking. Almost everyone knows that smoking causes cancer or heart disease and that it can shorten your life. Smoking is a hard habit to break because of the drugs in cigarettes. The problems are that it might turn teeth, nails, and toenails yellow and give people bad breath. People around smokers will be uncomfortable because of the smell and the smoke of the cigarettes. Personally, I think the government or any who are concerned should try to stop people from smoking, especially in public areas such as restaurants, parks, and malls. Many young people begin smoking as an act of rebellion and independence. Young smokers start smoking at the age of 12 or 13 just to get a taste of what it is like. Some of them find it disgusting and unhealthy and some of them find it cool. You can see smoking is bad for your health. Your health requires pure oxygen in life, so you must stop smoking and do something before it's too late.
