Smoking is a common term used to describe the habit of inhaling tobacco-based products such as cigarettes and cigars. People start for many reasons. First, they feel they will be relieved from their tensions. Second, they are attracted by the style of people who smoke and so they start smoking, leading to a bad habit. Thirdly, most people start unintentionally due to the environment and become addicted later on when they cannot stop, even intentionally. Smoking is lot more disadvantageous than it is beneficial. It is the cause of many diseases such as lung cancer. Smokers cannot run for long, so they cannot be a good athlete or sportsman. Smokers feel uneasy if they do not get their fix of nicotine at regular intervals. In fact, smoking leads to the addiction of other drugs. It causes complex personality problems. Smoking excessively may lead to a loss of fertility in males and females. A regular smoker, called a “chain smoker,” loses 48 minutes of his life with just one cigarette. A study has shown that people sitting around a smoker, who are even not smoking, are at risk of getting lung cancer before the smoker himself. So not only should one get away from smoking but also restrain one’s friends from smoking to save all in the community. That is why it is prohibited in public places by the government, thankfully. The basic component causing all the harm is nicotine. Can you drink the amount of nicotine in a cigarette in a glass? That is the point, so why do we inhale it?
