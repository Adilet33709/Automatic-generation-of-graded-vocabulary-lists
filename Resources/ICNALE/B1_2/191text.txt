I agree that bans on smoking should exist at all restaurants. Smoking is detrimental to the health of the smokers themselves and the people around them. Moreover, a large number of restaurants are in an enclosed space or building. For example, if smoking was allowed on McDonalds premises, then a lot of children would inhale secondhand smoke, and especially if it starts so young, it can cause lung cancer in the future. Also, bans are only in restaurants; it's not the entire country. Smokers can still have a cigarette after their meal. Surely, they are not so addicted to smoking that they can't spare a good 10-20 minutes for a meal. From the business perspective, I would segregate areas for smokers and non-smokers, as having a smoking area might play a part in deciding on where to dine. This is costly to the business either way. Without the smoking area, you might lose customers who are smokers. With the smoking area, you lose customers who don't appreciate the smoking. Further, just having two different areas costs more than having two different sections. For example, having an indoor and outdoor area. This means higher costs for a larger space, as it's not possible to segregate two distinct areas in an enclosed place. Without the ban in restaurants, you can sell cigarettes, which could boost sales. Overall, it's better not to have a smoking ban in restaurants. It benefits the general public and the smoker.
