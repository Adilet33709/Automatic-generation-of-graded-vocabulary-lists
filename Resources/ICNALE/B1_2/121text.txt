I agree with the idea that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. I would like to show you three reasons. The first reason is that restaurants should be places where you enjoy food, not smoke. Restaurants serve you very nice and special food. You can enjoy beautiful food with all your senses like seeing, smelling and tasting. But smoke can harm this very happy time. You cannot enjoy the appearance of food due to smoke. You cannot savor good smells due to smoke. You might not understand the real taste due to smoke. Cigarette smoke prevents you from enjoying a nice meal. Secondly, I want to mention that most of the people who don't smoke really hate smoke, especially when they have meals. People who don't smoke are more sensitive to smoke and the smell of cigarettes than smokers. Restaurants are different from outside places that can push away smoke and get fresh air. People cannot enjoy their dinner due to smoke. Finally, the third reason is that your smoking can harm other people who want to avoid bad effects on their health. People who are concerned about their health cannot help breathing smoke. For these three reasons, I believe that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.
