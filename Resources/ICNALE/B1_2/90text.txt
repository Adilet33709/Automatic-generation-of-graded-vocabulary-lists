If you are resolved to have a part-time job, what are your purposes? Is it the money, or is it the experiences and the learning in the process of working that lure you to take a job? As we know, most of us have to step into society after graduation, and the society which will confront us is quite different from the campus life we are used to living in. So, if money is your solitary goal and you cannot be distracted by the expansion of your circle or the acquisition of communication skills, I suggest you'd better concentrate on your study and do not bother to think of a part time job for the simple reason that high marks can get you a better job. But if you want a part-time job for more than just money, you can gain the advantage of all that it has to offer. In the change from an excellent university student to a new employee, you may be subjected to scorn and criticism often, which will prompt you to reflect on yourself and define who you are. Taking a part-time job will give you a glimpse of the real world and make you well-prepared for the future. By observing society first-hand, you learn a lot outside the book. So, you can see my opinions quite clear now. Put away the money you can get and let yourself develop quickly in your part-time job experience!
