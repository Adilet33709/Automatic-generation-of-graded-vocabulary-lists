I think smoking is a really bad habit to have. I have always hated the smell of smoke and detested walking behind people who were smoking. Being Singaporean students, we have always learned about the negatives of being a passive smoker. More importantly, I feel very sad for each and every smoker when I walk pass them. I really hope that they will stop smoking as it is really harmful to their bodies. On top of hurting themselves, they are also unknowingly hurting everyone around them by making them passive smokers and polluting the air. I hated it when I found out that my friends were smoking. I told them to stop but even until today, I am not truly sure if they have stopped smoking. I really hope that they have stopped. I do not see any positives about smoking actually, it wastes money as cigarettes are in fact really expensive and do harm. I sincerely hope that in the future, fewer people will be smoking cigarettes. According to my mother, my father used to be a smoker when he was younger. Thankfully, he stopped smoking before my parents got married. Since my father could stop in the past with no form of rehabilitation, I feel that this generation of smokers should have it easier because they can find help to stop smoking. "If there is a will, there is a way," is commonly quoted, so I feel that it is important for us to all to continually encourage our loved ones to stop smoking.
