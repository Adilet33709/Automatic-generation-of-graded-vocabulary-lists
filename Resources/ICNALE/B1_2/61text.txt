According to a survey, a large number of deaths occur every day due to smoking. Besides other factors, smoking is the most prominent. Children are the major target of smoking, because when they reach college or university level, they consider themselves free and feel they can do anything they want. Because of this free environment and looking at others surrounding them, they also start smoking. They find pleasure in smoking, and they try to show off their smoking. They smoke at least one or two packets daily just to enjoy, without thinking about the harmful effects. They slowly go off the smoke of cigarettes. Nowadays, a new type of cigarette or smoking has been introduced, which people call shisha; it is a type of hookah but smaller in size, so the new generation feels proud about having it. They go to hotel clubs to smoke it. They can take it to their home or stay at the club and kill themselves by smoking it. Electronic media also play a vital role in spreading this curse. Every day, there are million advertisements of cigarettes, and another reason for so many smokers is that cigarettes are easily available to everyone. Even a child can access them in any shop at any time. The government should create some laws that prohibit the sale of cigarettes to children.
