I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I think most people agree, too. Restaurants are public places, not private places. I don't think smoking is bad; smoking in restaurants is bad. Non-smokers are harmed by smokers because of secondhand smoking. I have seen that secondhand smoking is more harmful than smoking in the news. Smoking in restaurants exposes other people to disease. The target could be your own family. Imagine one case; today is a family dinner. Your son sits next to you. You start smoking, and your son breathes your smoke. Your son is non-smoker. What does your son think about you? Maybe he feels shame, because he has a conscience. He thinks your smoking in restaurants is wrong. Don't you agree? Everyone knows smoking in restaurants is not good - child, adult, teenager, or elderly. You must mostly think about people's health. Don't smoke in restaurants only for your pleasure. If you want to smoke during a meal, then go outside and smoke; that is manners. Nowadays almost all restaurants have a smoking room. Your few steps will be other persons' happiness. For most persons' happiness, smoking in restaurants should be banned and smokers must observe this law. That's a win-win strategy for both sides.
