I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have some reasons to agree with this idea. First, a part-time job is good training for real work for college students. College students have to work after they graduate from their college. Then, experience from their part-time jobs will help them. For example, if they work in an office, they can learn computer skills. Second, part-time jobs also give students social experiences. Students learn how they should act in society. For example, if the students work as waiters or waitresses, they can learn polite expressions and good manners. This will help them when they are given a job interview. And, of course, in the company, politeness and manners are also very important. Third, most student work in part-time jobs so they can earn money. They can use that money as they want. For some students, that is the first money they earn all by themselves. They can learn the value of the money they use, too. They can also learn how hard it is to earn money and live in the future. For these reasons, I think that having a part-time job is important for college students.
