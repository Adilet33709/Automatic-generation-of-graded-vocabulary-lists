In my opinion, being a smoker harms our body, and I absolutely hate smokers around me. My father is a smoker so I stay away from him when he smokes. I'm pretty confused by the people who smoke in places such as terminals, malls, and buses. In my mind, I always wonder whether they realize there are people among them? Definitely, they don't think about that and they don't have any respect for them. I have a lot of reasons why we should not smoke. First, smoking affects our health, and we must spend a lot of money buying cigarettes, and we know that being a smoker damages our lungs. And you can get some diseases such as cancer that reduce the length and quality of your life. And the other reason is out of respect for the people around you, because smoking is pretty disturbing to others. When you smoke, you not only harm yourself but you also harm all the people around you, so you must be selfish. If you love yourself, please stop smoking!! Think about the people around you, who love you, like your friends and your family. I'm sure they won't want to see you suffering or sick because of it. You just spend your life, your money, and most importantly, you will spend much money on medicine when you get sick. So, you should think hard about stopping smoking because we have dreams for our life. I really disagree about smokers, who don't have any respect for themselves and other people.
