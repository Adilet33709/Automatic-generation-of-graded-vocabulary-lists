Smoking is harmful to everybody. Those who like to smoke harm their families, friends, and people surrounding them, because secondhand smoke contains a lot of toxic chemicals, which cause lung cancer and heart disease. But those who like to smoke find it difficult to quit the bad habit. When they smoke in a public place, the people around them feel uncomfortable, as smoking affects their health. The government should completely ban smoking in all public places. Ninety percent of people support it, but smokers say that such a law would deprive them of their rights. It's a really difficult problem. Maybe smokers could think about quitting smoking; it would be salutary to themselves and their families or friends. I am not a smoker, and I think it is essential to completely ban smoking in public. The law prevents others from the harm caused by second-hand smoke. The amount of fumes others smell and breathe in from smokers is really annoying. Banning smoking in public places doesn't deprive smokers of their rights, but it protects other people's right. Smokers will still have the right to smoke in their private space, and non-smokers will be free from smoke in public places. Isn't it a wonderful law?
