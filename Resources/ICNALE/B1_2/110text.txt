Recently, several bans forbidding smoking in all restaurants have been published, which has brought on heated discussions. As far as I'm concerned, to those bans I can't agree more. The reasons are just as follows: first and foremost, smoking is basically harmful to people's health, especially to the lungs, which can lead to fatal diseases, such as cancer. Secondly, as a restaurant is a public location, smoking there can not only hurt smokers themselves, but also do harm to those around them. What's worse, if there is a pregnant woman in the restaurant, the harm can be catastrophic. Thirdly, as there might be many non-smokers in the restaurant, perhaps even some smoking-sensitive people, smoking can lead to quarrelling, which will destroy the harmony and influence consumers' moods in the restaurant. Last but not least, even considering that several smokers are addicted to smoking, many other spaces outside of restaurants are still provided for them. All in all, smoking should be banned completely at all restaurants in the country. In order to realize this aim, it is not enough that only the government implements some bans. Citizens, both smokers and non-smokers, ought to join in this campaign. Smokers can remind themselves that smoking is banned in the restaurant when they have the desire to take a cigarette out. Non-smokers can give advice to those who want to smoke during dinner to not smoke instead of just tolerating them or quarrelling with them directly. Only in these ways can smoking be completely banned in all restaurants in the country.
