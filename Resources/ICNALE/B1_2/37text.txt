Nowadays, college education has attracted the attention of society. What should the college education be? What ought college students to learn? The most common argument is whether college students should take a part-time job. In my opinion, having a part-time job is vital for students. As we all know, students have a lot of free time to manage, so it would be very convenient for them to take a part-time job. In the future, students must step into society and face a variety of difficulties. Having a job can help them gain life experience; what's more, they can meet all walks of life and learn how to cope with complex relationships between them and colleagues. Further, students can make their own money and may realize that it is hard for parents to earn money. However, having a part-time job also has an unfavorable aspect. As the main task for students is to study, having a job may occupy most of their free time and may affect students' daily lives. Taking a part-time job is not a bad thing as long as we do not overwork but stick to reality and our personalities. I think if we can manage our time efficiently to take a job, we will be sure to get lots of benefits and more chances to be distinguished in the future.
