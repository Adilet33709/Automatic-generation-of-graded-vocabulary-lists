I agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. As we know, smoking is not good for our health. First of all, cigarettes contain nicotine that can damage our lungs and make it hard for us to breathe. The government also gives warnings to smokers to reduce the number of smokers. We can see the warnings on every pack of cigarettes, and it is said that smoking can cause cancer, hypertension, and also disturb fetuses. Smoking affects not only us, but also other people. Smoke destroys the fresh air and sometimes causes people to cough when they breathe it in. If smoking is not banned, it can annoy other people that do not smoke, who are called passive smokers. The smoke of cigarettes is more dangerous for passive smokers than for active smokers, because the smoke that is aspirated by the active smoker is not good for our health. We must maintain our health because we are the next generation of our nation. Besides, we must make the environment better and keep the air fresh and free from smoke. Those are some reasons why smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.
