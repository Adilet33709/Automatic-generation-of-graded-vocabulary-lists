Yes, smoking should be banned from all restaurants across the country, simply because not all of the people in the restaurant smoke, so it can make them uncomfortable while eating or bonding with their family or friends. Banning smoking in restaurants can attract customers and help the owner of the restaurant to earn more money because other people like restaurants that have good air while they are eating with their family or friends. Moreover, by banning smoking others will not be exposed to second-hand smoke which may lessen sicknesses related to smoking, such as asthma, sinus infections, and heart attacks. In my own opinion, smoking should be banned in all places, simply because it not only effects the smoker but also the non-smoking people around them and may cause several pulmonary diseases like coughing, bronchitis, asthma, and complications in the lungs and heart. Many young people are attracted to smoking because they see being done by the people around them and think it is a good thing to do. These people should be taught that it is not good for their health and the health of others. I think all elders should quit smoking to be a model for youngsters that they can stop smoking and live a healthy life.
