Everywhere we turn there is someone who is smoking; whether it may be in the open or inside a building. Smoking is even a trend now among college students. Inside buildings there are areas made for people who smoke so that they do not disturb others. Even in restaurants there are more common areas for smoking than just for dinning in. This should be banned whether smokers like it or not. Most people smoke, but that does not exempt them from very simple rules and policies. Why smoke in a room if it's only use is for eating? It's very rude, not only to the diners but also to the reputation of the restaurant. The toxic smoke from cigarettes not only repels more customers rather than reeling them in, but also no one likes to eat something good while breathing in something foul. If others do not want to be near smokers, then why should they eat in that restaurant at all? Being repulsed by smoking, the restaurant's reputation will go down and eventually they will close within a month's time. People don't eat smoke, they eat food. Eventually it will be the restaurant owner/s that will have to endure the hardships caused by smokers.
