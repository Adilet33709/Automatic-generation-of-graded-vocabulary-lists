I agree with the statement. College students, mostly in their 20s, are adults with social lives that require money, such as going out for dinners or shopping for clothes. Therefore, having an income (even a small one) is useful for college students in ensuring that their social lives are not compromised during the school term. Moreover, having to rely on parents for additional income can be a little embarrassing and may put a strain on their financial resources. Therefore, I feel that it is better for college students to have their own income. While it can sometimes be tough to manage one's time, especially with assignments and other school commitments, students still have the opportunity to be flexible with their part-time job by taking fewer shifts or quitting (as a last resort), since they are not obliged to continue in the long term. Part-time jobs that enable flexibility include being a tutor or working on an ad-hoc basis by modeling or screen-writing. I therefore conclude that it is imperative that college students have a part-time job in order to keep up with their social lifestyles and not burden their parents, some of whom may already be retired.
