In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants in the country because a restaurant is a general place for people to eat their meals. It is also a favorite place for everyone to hang out with their family or friends, so many people spend their time at restaurants. If there is someone that smokes, it will disturb the enjoyment of other people. The smoke of the cigarettes will pollute the environment and endanger the not only the smokers but also the people who do not smoke. Some people, especially ladies, cannot stand the smoke of cigarettes and the smoke will certainly harm them. They may not enjoy their meal or they may even have difficulty breathing. Also, cigarettes are bad for our health, especially secondhand smoke. Smoke which arises when a person smokes a cigarette or cigar is more hazardous to a passive smoker who inhales the smoke being in the close vicinity of the active smoker. The smoke being inhaled by the former is unfiltered thereby causing more ill effects. Several pulmonary diseases such as coughs, bronchitis, asthma, and carcinoma of the lungs may occur as a consequence of smoking. So, to keep our body healthy, not only should restaurants should ban smoking, but also other general places.
