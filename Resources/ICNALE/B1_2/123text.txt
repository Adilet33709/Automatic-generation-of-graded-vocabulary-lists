I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have three reasons to support my stance. Firstly, a part-time job is an important chance to experience society. Because a college is the place to prepare before going to the real society, a part-time job is very necessary to know how severe working is or how we may enjoy it. In my experience, I learned that even one mistake cannot be allowed in service through working in bakery. I also noticed the importance of the relationship with my seniors. The second reason is to solve a monetary problem. I think college students need a lot of money for texts or for some entertainment. However, we are already adults and should not totally depend on our parents for finance. Therefore it is better to earn by ourselves as much as possible. As for me, I can live without working if I could ask my parents to support me but I chose to work. This is because I have to learn how to manage myself before graduating university. After I started to work, I actually began to understand the importance of money when I buy something. Lastly, I think a part-time job is a good opportunity to get new friends. In a college, it is difficult to find so many kinds of friends because ages and departments are limited. However, if we work, we can meet many kinds of people regardless of ages or location. I think such relationships are precious even after getting older. For all those reasons, I strongly believe that having a part-time job is important for college students.
