It is essential for university students to have part-time jobs because they can get experiences of working life. As they are the future pillars of the society, they need to prepare themselves well to contribute to their country. Also, the can become mature enough to handle the difficulties in their future working environment as they will be experienced. It is a gateway for them to be a successful person. Part-time jobs offer an all-round education for students because they can develop their interpersonal skills, which cannot be learned from books. In addition, communicating with their counterparts or boss is important for their mental growth because students are very sensitive. They have received an education since they were young, so it is high time they applied their knowledge to a working environment. They can earn more money for their daily expenditure as the school fees and living costs are very high at universities. They may not need to receive grant loans from the government, and they can become financially independent, which can reduce the burden on their families and the government. I strongly agree that students need to take part-time jobs since there are many advantages.
