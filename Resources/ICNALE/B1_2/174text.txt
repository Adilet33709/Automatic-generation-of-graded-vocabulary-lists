A part-time job is a job that is done in addition to a person’s regular job to increase his income to meet his expenses. For instance, if a person who works as a clerk in an office starts another job like a mobile shop in his free time in the afternoon, he is doing a part-time job. There is a need for a part-time job in two cases. First, a person doing a part-time job may have less income than expenses. Second, a person who is not short of income but wants to improve his life by getting a car instead of a bike, a house instead of renting, or daily fruits rather than weekly food etc. A part-time job is a hard job and always done with a short timeframe in mind. That is, people always start such jobs with the intention of leaving that job after achieving temporary targets such as the marriage of their daughters or the studies of their children. Most of the time, a part-time job is not done for more than six hours and people are not professional in such jobs. It is common in countries where inflation rates are high or people are showy. They want to meet the self-created, useless standards in the society, and for that purpose, they get such jobs. There is a loss also in that we cannot pay for the basic purpose of coming into this world, which is to pray. Especially being Muslim, one should realize that we are here to pray and to make others pray because no prophet will come now, and we are responsible for preaching the reason of being sent to this temporary world. In this context, a part-time job is just a waste of time, because it is not always done by someone in need. People should control their desires.
