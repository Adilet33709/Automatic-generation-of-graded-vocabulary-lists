The issue of banning smoking has been a hot topic of debate recently. I think smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants because cigarettes contain different kinds of harmful substances shown in many discoveries to cause tumors and lead to death. Cigarettes also contain chemicals that make users become addicted, and they can increase air pollution. Some people may be annoyed by the smoke that is being breathed out, especially in indoor areas, which are less well ventilated. However, some people, including restaurant managers, may argue it should not be banned at all restaurants since it may affect the flow of customers, including smokers, who may choose not to go. In addition, there are some difficulties in defining the areas of the restaurants if the laws are made, such as the seating area outside the restaurant and the outdoor catering area, and another problem may arise in relation to the penalty for violating the laws. In conclusion, while I support the idea of banning smoking at all restaurants, some unsolved aspects still have to be tackled in relation to the regulations.
