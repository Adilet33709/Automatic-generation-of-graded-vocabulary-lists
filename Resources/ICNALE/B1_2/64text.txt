A part-time job is a job taken outside of classes in college. If we have a part-time job, we gain a lot of experience. We learn to arrange time. We learn to arrange money. Further, we learn to do the job in groups in the office we work in. Work is not easy. It's not simple like a class in university. You have to do the job according to the customer's tastes. For example, if you take a part-time job as a freelance photographer, you may have to prove to your customer through a portfolio that you are a real photographer and that you can complete the job in a good condition and take good pictures. If you have good management, you can save a lot of earnings from your part-time job. On the other hand, some parents do not want or disagree that college students should have a part-time job because they think that if the students have a job, they may become lazy to go to class in university. However, the condition applies again for the students: they must be able to arrange their time.
