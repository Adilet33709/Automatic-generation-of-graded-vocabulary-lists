Living in the Philippines, a developing nation, I am no stranger to seeing the impoverished. Poverty can be seen almost everywhere. Studying in De La Salle University – Manila, one of the country's most prestigious universities, I was given the opportunity to see the stark contrast in society as the slums encompass a significant area around the school campus. From what I could observe, poverty has taken its toll, most especially on the children. Deprived of education and proper parental guidance, many of them can be seen loitering outside the campus. Fortunately, however, there are those who have strived or in the local language “nag-kayod”, to rise from the slums. There are those impoverished who have diligently worked their way through college to earn a decent living for their families. One factor that enabled this is the prevalence of part-time jobs. These are jobs that are, well, not full-time. For businessmen this could mean fewer benefits to pay and the ability to be more flexible in terms of employee overhead. For the impoverished, however, it means the world to them. Part-time jobs can range anywhere from several hours work to several months. They range from cleaning other's cars or homes, to tutoring their kids, to working at fast food joints. Part-time jobs may seem detrimental to some, as they won't have occupational security; they are, nonetheless, essential for others, and in aggregate are beneficial for society.
