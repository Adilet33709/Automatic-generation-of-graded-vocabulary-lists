When college life starts, students enter a new phase of their lives. College life is quite different from school life, and the students’ expenditures increase. Some parents cannot afford the academic expenditures, so they do not permit their children to get an education. However, students with good academic records and those who continue with their education often start doing part-time jobs to cover their expenditures along with their studies. However, I totally disagree with it. Even though it is useful that students can help their parents, I disagree with part-time jobs because students are the main pillars of society. They are the backbone of our progress. Therefore, they should give their full time and potential to their studies. If they start working at part-time jobs, it would be more difficult for them to manage their jobs and their studies. In this way, they would not be able to give their best in either one of them. In fact, they would become tired and frustrated. Part-time work could exhaust them and they could fail to cope with their studies. As a result, they would be inefficient and get poor results in college. Students are at the golden time of their life. It is the time when they have wishes because they are not mature enough. They wanted to plunge into the stars, so they should not have to do any part-time jobs. In fact, they should focus on their goals.
