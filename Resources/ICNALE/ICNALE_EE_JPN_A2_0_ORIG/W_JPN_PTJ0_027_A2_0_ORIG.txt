I agree that college students have a part-time job. There are five reasons to support my opinion. Firstly, by doing part-time job, they can find earning money very hard. So, they use their money seriously. And the college students have much time. So if they want travel abroad, they can make money by doing part-time job for their own. Planning how to use money is helpful when they begin to work. Secondly, if they do a part-time job, they can meet people of variety generation, from children to senior adults. So they can know various people's way of thinking. Thirdly, the harder they do a part-time job, the more evaluated they are. For example, their salary per hour is maybe up. Fourthly, by doing many kinds of part-time job, they can know their suitable future job such as teaching children, or serve customs in shops, and so on. In fact, I have a lot of friends who want to become teachers. And they teach junior high school students studying. Lastly, they have responsibility for their job. It is an important thing when they work. As above, they can know society's basic rules. This is why I agree that college students have a part-time job.
