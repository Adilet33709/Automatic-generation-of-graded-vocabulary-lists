I agree with the statement. There are three reasons why I agree with that. First, people who smoke everyday often get bad health. For example, to feel tired every time, and to become cancer. If you were so, you can't live with happiness. It is very serious problems. To live healthy is the most important thing. Second, people around smoking people feel bad, and is also get bad effects. The smells are bad for non-smoking people. They can't eat dinner with peppiness. And the second-hand smoke is more dangerous for other than smoking people. It is more serious problem than the first or second problems. Finally, some smoking people's manner is bad. For example, after smoking, some people throw the trash out. It is also serious problem for other people. Some people might say that developing country people get money from making cigarette. It is true. If we ban smoking, their jobs are not needed. However, the job making someone to be bad health is the worst job. Smoking is dangerous, and is completely bad. It is better that buy others than cigarette. It is good for you, and other people. It is why I agree with the statement.
