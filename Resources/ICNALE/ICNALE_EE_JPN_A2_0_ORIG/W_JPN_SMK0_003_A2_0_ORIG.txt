I agree with the preceding statement. From the beginning, smoking is the bad things for health. The man who likes smoking will disagree, smoking damage is for all people include not smoker. From older to child come to the restaurant. At the restaurant, people enjoy eating and talking. People may think the food isn't delicious. And they have a pain and they can't enjoy talking. I think that restaurant must be the place it is comfortable for all people. In addition, completely banning help to stop smoking for health. If the number of the place where forbid smoking increase, smoker should put up with smoking a long time. Today, divide the seats that allow smoking from the seats that forbid smoking in Japan. However, if we were the seats that forbid smoking, I feel uncomfortable by smoke. It is because restaurant isn't perfect isolation. If the man who says that smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, the reason will be smoker feel uncomfortable. One thing that I suggest is setting up the smoking room in the restaurant. I deal with the smoking room equality to toilet. It is completely private room, several seat in the room. I think we set up the smoking room in the restaurant, smoker can satisfy too.
