I disagree with this opinion. Smoking should not be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. First, restaurant is the place which people not only eat food but also relax. In my experience, I have relaxed at restaurant in talking with my friends and sleeping. Some people relax in smoking. If smoking is banned at all restaurants, they can not relax at restaurant. Business at restaurant will decrease. Second, smoking is not always bringing travels. Actually, some people don't like others smoking. But deviding smoking area will solve the problem. It enables the men who wants to smoke to smoke and the man who doesn't want to smoke to avoid others smoking. Third, I think there is no merit to ban smoking at all restaurant in Japan. All problem about smoking, except about health, is solved enough by deviding smoking area, and what is need any more? Nothing is need. But deviding smoking area is more need to perform. We have to be more careful to devide smoking area not to ban. What can be done at restaurant is limited. But, for example, I agree that smoking is banned at other public area in Japan, not restaurant. Smoking is not only the problem in restaurant.
