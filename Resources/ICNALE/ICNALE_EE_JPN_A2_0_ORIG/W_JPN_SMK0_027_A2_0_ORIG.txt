I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are four reasons to support my opinion. Firstly, many people go to the restaurant at lunch time and dinner time. Restaurants are the place where many kinds of people are. Smoke does their health harm. Many families with children go to the restaurant at dinner. Children are stronger effected than adults. And the research revealed that smoked people are more harmed than smoking people. Secondly, if some people smoke while the other people are having meals, people who are not smoke can't taste their meals very much because of the smoke. Thirdly, students, such as junior high school students and senior high school students, often go to the restaurant. If they see people smoke at the time, they could be affected by the scene. And they begin to be interested in smoke, in spite of be under 20, they could begin to smoke. Lastly, in these days, there are restaurants which is allowed to enter with their pets, for example they are called dog café. Not only man but also dogs, smoking may do harm. This is whyⅠagree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
