I agree with the preceding statement. Because, I think that college students need a lot of money. I have two reasons for it. First, They should buy as many as books and read them. They can study a lot of things from the many books. If they go to the library, they can read the many books, but they are forbidden writing in the books of library. I think writing in the books for studying is very important. Therefore, college students need much money to buy a lot of books. Second, they need to make many friends. To make a friend, they will belong to a club. On the club activities, they will need much money. If they get friend, they enjoy eating and drinking with their friends. In summer vacation, they will plan to have a trip in overseas. I think college students need to studying and playing. A part-time job gives them not only the money but also the wonderful experiences. It is the very precious things that working in the society, and finding the various things. For example, they feel the importance for responsible for them work and difficulty with getting a money. I think college students should have a part-time job, and study a lot of things.
