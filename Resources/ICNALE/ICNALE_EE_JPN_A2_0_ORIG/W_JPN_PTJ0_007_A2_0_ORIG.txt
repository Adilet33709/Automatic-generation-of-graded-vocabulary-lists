I agree with it. I have three reasons to support my answer. Firstly, I think we should have a part-time job to learn how work before employed in a company. We go to a university to learn many things before employed and we have much time to do something after classes. We can choose whether we have a part-time job to learn how work or not. So we should have it. Secondly, I suppose we should know how hard earning is. I had not known that earning money to live is really hard since I have had part-time job. And I could thank my parents. I think it is important for us to know how hard earning and thank parents. Thirdly, we can use payments of part-time job to do many things for experiences. As I said we have much time in a university. And we can do something for ourselves by using payments of part-time job. For example, we can go travel and see the world, buy books, organize a student conference and so on. I think that experiences will help us after graduate. So I agree that is important for college students to have a part-time job. Because we can learn how work, we can know how hard earning is and we can get good experiences thanks to part-time job.
