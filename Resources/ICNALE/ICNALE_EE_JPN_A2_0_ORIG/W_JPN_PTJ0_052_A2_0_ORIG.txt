I agree with this statement, because having a part-time job is very important to learn our society. My opinion is that it is important for high school students to study many subjects, which is Math, English, Science, Japanese, Society, etc. Therefore high school students should not work a part-time job. But college students must work after graduating a college, so while they are college students they should learn about the work. So I think they should have a part-time job. They have a part-time job and they get some money. To addition they can learn the hardness and the important to get some money. By getting some money they can move a wide area and go to abroad to learn much knowledge which is the country's culture, its play, its language and its clothes etc. But they must not work too much, so their object is to learn much technical knowledge. I think they should not work more than four times a week. Because working four times a week is more than half of a week. My conclusion is that college student should have a part-time job, but their most thing to do are studying, so they must not work too much.
