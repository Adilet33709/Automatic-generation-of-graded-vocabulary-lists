I don't like smoking. So I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have two reasons. First, it is true that smoking gives serious damage not only a person who smoke but also a person who is near from his or her. People who smoke get lung cancer than people who don't smoke. Second, I think the most serious problem is smoking at the restaurant make people who don't smoke feel very uncomfortable. Break fast, lunch, and dinner is the time that all of the people enjoy eating and relax. And a restaurant is the place where people enjoy eating and relax. At the same time, however, a restaurant is not the private place but the public place. Perhaps some people relax when they smoke. But I think smoking in a restaurant is bad manner. To enjoy eating all of the people, each person should stop smoking. So all the restaurants should make a rule that bans smoking. If people want to smoke, they should go outside and enjoy smoking. These days smoking banned day by day. I think it is good moving for all of the people to make comfortable environment and good health.
