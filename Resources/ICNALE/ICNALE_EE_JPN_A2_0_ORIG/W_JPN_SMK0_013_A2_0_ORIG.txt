I agree with that. To be sure, we can smoke anytime and anywhere. But smoking should be banned at official place such as restaurants. As you know, smoking is not good for our health. Generally speaking, people who smoke in daily life become sick often. For example, smokers are apt to get cancer. In fact, there is a lot of data that a number of smokers are suffered from cancer. In addition to this, health of surrounding people is also influenced by smoke. Smoke causes illness other people who take it in their body. Moreover, smoke smell very bad and makes people who are near a smoker feel bad. In a restaurant, guests would like to have a good time by eating delicious dishes comfortably. However, they can't do that near smokers because smoke makes them uncomfortable. There are a lot of restaurants setting the space that people can smoke. It is a very good idea and very nice for people who are not smoke. But, I don't agree that idea because people are sitting beside the border between smoking area and non-smoking are annoyed. For these reasons, I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
