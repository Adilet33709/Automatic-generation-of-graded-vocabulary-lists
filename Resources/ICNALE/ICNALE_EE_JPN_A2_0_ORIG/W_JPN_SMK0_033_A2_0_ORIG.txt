I agree the statement Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. And I don't agree the statement smoking is personal habit. I think that all humans can live by the time, a human as biological thing live by the end time he can. But, in real world, most of humans die by early or middle time in biological human's life, said over 200 ages. I think the complex things kill people by the time they touch their end as biological things. For example, Smoking is the worst. Smoking makes not only a human's body but around people's bad. It is called, Fukuryu-en. Fukuryu-en is that smoke from a person smoking moves to other persons around the person, and this doing is the anti-manner thing because this smoke from one person makes other persons bad condition, for example Zensoku, cancer called Haigan or others, especially in common area where a lot of people are, for example parks, stations, airports, streets or others. The cancer called Haigan is the worst sickness. This sickness's killing rate is high rate and a lot of Japanese people were killed by this sickness. Smoking has large relationship to Haigan and many scientists think smoking causes Haigan So I think smoking should be completely banned in places where many people are.
