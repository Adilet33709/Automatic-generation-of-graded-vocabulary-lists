I disagree with this opinion. I think part-time job is not need for college students. First, college student must study hard. It is very important for college student to study. I think that student is the man who studies academic or is educated not works. If student thinks that study is had finished, it is wrong. Study is not limited. Second, I think that college student who is working a part-time job now or not will graduate and be working at least about four years later. After all, college student will have to work. So, now college student should not work. Third, working is very hard and spent a lot of times. A man said the one hour for college or university student values the ten years for old man. Actually, the period which is spend in college or university is very important. Student must spend this time seriously. Fourth, there are a lot of thing for student to do, except study. The club activity may raise up college student. It teaches a lot of thing which is not gotten in education. College student should spend many time in them, not working. I think part-time job is not need for college student.
