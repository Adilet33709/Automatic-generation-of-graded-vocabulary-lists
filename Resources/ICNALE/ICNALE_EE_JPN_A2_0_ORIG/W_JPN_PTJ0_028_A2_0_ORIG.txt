I agree with the statement. There are three reasons. First, college students need a lot of money. They must pay money to college. And it needs to buy cloths, and to eat, drink in order to be friendly. They should not have their parents to pay a lot for them. They should pay the costs by themselves. So they should have a part-time job. Second, they can make friends when they work. To work together, they will become friendly. It is very good to have many friends. For example, when he or she has a problem, he or she can want the friends to advice. Their advice might be different from college friends. It is important to hear many kinds of advice. Finally, it is able to practice for their job in future to have a part-time job. If they have not have a part-time job, they don't know what kind of job is good for them. To have a part-time job is good chance to notice them. Some people might say that they can study more if they don't have that. It is true. However, I think it is more important to have that. They will be good person. It is why I agree with the statement.
