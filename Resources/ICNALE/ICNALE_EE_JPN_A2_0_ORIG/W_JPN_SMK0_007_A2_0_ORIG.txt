I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. And I have three reasons to support my answer. First, I think we don't need to smoke in a restaurant, because we go to there to enjoy good dishes not to smoke. Our purpose is not smoking. Second, I'd like to say that we can't enjoy tastes of dishes when we smoke, because smoke taste is really stronger than dishes. I think we can't have a good lunch or dinner even we go to a restaurant to enjoy dishes. Third, smoke is not good for health of the non-smoke people who come to a restaurant. Non-smoke people must breathe smoke when someone smokes in a restaurant even if non-smoke people don't hope it. Non-smoke people must lose their chances to have a good lunch or dinner because of smoking. And smoke is not good for our health and taste of dishes, especially for children of growing up. So I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country Because we don't go to a restaurant to smoke, we can't enjoy dishes when smoke and smoke is not good health of non-smoke people especially for children.
