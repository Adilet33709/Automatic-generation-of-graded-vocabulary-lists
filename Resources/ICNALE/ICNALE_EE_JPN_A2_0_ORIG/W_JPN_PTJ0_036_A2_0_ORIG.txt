I agree with this idea I think college students should have some part-time jobs. I also think they should study hard while they are students. They must live well between part-time jobs and study. This is not because college students need much money. If they have a part-time job, they have many friends and meet many types of a way of thinking. I think there are two types of a part-time job. First one is a job in juku. If you do a part-time job in juku, you must have your own student. You have to study too. Your knowledge which you study before is useful. Second one is a job in stores. If you work as a shop clerk, you must communicate with a lot of customers. Your communication ability will make progress. You will have much responsibility. It is hard to continue a part-time job. But the very responsibility is needed in society. You will have to have responsibility in everything you do when you become adult. If you have a part-time job, your sight will be wide. Before you start life in society, you should practice to communicate with many other people and know how to survive in the society.
