I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have three reasons. First, if students have a part-time job, they can know how they work in society. they will have to work when they graduate their colleges. So I think they should have time to prepare for working in society. Second, If they work in various situations, they will learn how they communicate with people. College students should experience various situations. Third, college students need a lot of money when they graduate their colleges. So they must earn some money to use then. I think it is too late for them to earn money when they become emploees. Because most college students are adults, they should earn their own money. However, the most thing they should do is study. College students should have enough time to study. It is useless for them to have no time for study because of working too hard. College students don't have to earn too much money. So I think they should work on summer vacation, winter vacation, etc. If they experience working, it make their life more valuable thing.
