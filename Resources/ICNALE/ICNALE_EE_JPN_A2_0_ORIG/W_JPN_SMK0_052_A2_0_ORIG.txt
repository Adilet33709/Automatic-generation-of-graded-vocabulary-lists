I agree with this statement without thinking, so I dislike smoking for the reason of smelling bad and being dirty. Smoking is very bad for the smoker's health and is troubled to other people. Particularly the restaurants are the main place of eating, so smoking around people who eats something is very bad to atmosphere, smell, and taste. It is important for the dish to be a good taste, a good smell, and good atmosphere. Tobacco has a bad smell which is harm for human and a smoke which is a white and grey gas. There are many children in the restaurant. A smoke of tobacco is very bad for a child. Moreover a smoke of tobacco soaks through his or her clothes. If someone smokes in the restaurant, we cannot wear new clothes. We must mind about this. Smoker should stop smoking in the restaurant as early as they can, and they will be health in the future. If they die early because of smoking, their family will be very sad. They regret that he doesn't stop smoking. Therefore people who smoke tobacco should stop smoking in the restaurant. And I think whether smoking in the restaurant should be crime.
