I don't think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I don't like smoking but I think smokers want to smoke even if they go to the restaurant to eat or drink something. If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, smokers will have little place to smoke. Then, smokers can't refresh in anywhere. I think it better to have some place in restaurants in which smokers can smoke. However, I dislike only a little smoke and there are small children and babies. So, I want to completely separate the seats of smokers from the seats of nonsmoking person. Recently, a company or a department store, for example, has a smoking room. Smokers can smoke only in the room. I think this is a very good tendency. Smokers can refresh in the room and nonsmoking person can protect from smoke. Smoking is very bad not only for smoker's health but also for nonsmoking person's health. Nowadays, there is also a cigarette tax. The place they can smoke is smaller and smaller. Therefore, I hope that the number of smokers will gradually decrease. Now, a price of cigarette is a little higher than before. Some smokers begin to give up smoking to save money.
