I agree the statement which it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Because I think college students have skills of work in adult's society. Today, part-time jobs have spread of many parts of industry and become important role of these parts. Many companies want young people to work as part-time jobs so we who are college students, young man or girls, have more chance which we can have many experience of hard things in work in adult's society. If we have real experiences but non-real experiences which are heard, listened, talked, we will can get a good road of our future life. For example, I am working in Kobetsukan, a private school to be teached like in a formal school, as a part-time worker. That is my first job as a job to make money and teaches myself what I am realized as a worker in adult society. In the private school, I am called NARUSAWA Teacher and students see me as a professional teacher, but I cannot judge this is true or not. When I was seen as a professional worker, I could know the mean to work in the adult society. It is I have to play a role as the character other people expect me to. That I knew the mean is the biggest mean for working as a part-time job.
