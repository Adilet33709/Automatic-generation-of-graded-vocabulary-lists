I disagree with that. To be sure, to have a part-time to live is vital for college students. But it isn't good to earn money to play. Generally speaking, college students have more free time than high school students and junior high school students. And how to use their time all depends on them. Many college students spend a lot of time working part-time because they need to earn money to play with friends. Making many friends in college is good, however, and studying is also important. In college, there are many things to do for them, for example, taking part in an internship, a club, a seminar, and so on. So, college students should challenge actively what they can do only in college. By challenging a lot, they are able to their best with confidence when they work in the future. Wages of a part-time job are very low generally, and working part-time is very tiring for college students. So, it costs them much time and effort to get money in working part-time. As a result, they can't often concentrate on a class and study for a test in college often. It is not good for them. Therefore, I don't think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
