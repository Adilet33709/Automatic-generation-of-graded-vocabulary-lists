I agree with smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Because restaurant is a place which has function to eat and drink for visitor. Restaurant is not correct place to smoking. Some people maybe do smoking after they finish their eat, but how about other people? Are they like to do it? I think they feel uncomfortable about that situation. If that situation happened, government must look for solution about this problem. Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. It is solution for people who doesn't like smoking. As we know, the visitor who come in restaurants is from any age. From young until old people can be visitor at that restaurant. Smoker must know about that. They can make dirty condition at that restaurant. So, restaurant must give a special place for that smoker, if that smoker want smoking. It is better solution for smoker and the visitor who doesn't like smoking at that restaurant. If that smoker obey that regulation, restaurant can give a punishment. Maybe that smoker clean the plate and glass from visitor, or clean the restaurant floor. I hope that solution can make smoker give up and they will not do it again. So, they can keep a clean condition at that restaurant. I hope that solution can be done at all restaurants in other country beside on Indonesia. So, the visitor can feel comfort and don't worry with cigarette smoke at restaurant.
