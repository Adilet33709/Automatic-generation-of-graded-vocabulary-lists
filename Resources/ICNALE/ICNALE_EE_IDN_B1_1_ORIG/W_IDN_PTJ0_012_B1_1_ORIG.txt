A part time job can be alternative for college student to earn money. Students who have a part time job is independent student because they aren't only study their lessons in college but also work for get salary. They can use free time to spend a part time job so they can pay their finance in the college. They want to earn money from their self without must hope money from their parents. It is important for college students because I think college students because I think college students must can be independent person before they graduated from their college. With have a part time job, college students can get a new experience in the out of college. They will use that experience after graduated from their college to do a job better than other people. They hope after graduated they don't be awkward in the working environment because they already have a job experience before graduated. I really believe that college students to have a part time job will be a success person. Because they can use their time for study and work hardly. They have already through their experiments for earn salary theirself without depend to their parents for get money. They can defend in their life without have to get money from their parents. That's why many company look for people who have many experience in the part time job in order to be awkward when they work in the company and they can do the job very well. In this global world, every college students are hoped can use their skills, it's not only hard skills from their college but also soft skills from their experience in the out of college.
