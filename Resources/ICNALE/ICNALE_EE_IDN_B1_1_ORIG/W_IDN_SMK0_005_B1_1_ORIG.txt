I agree with that statement because many people in Indonesia is smoker. Whereas in reality smoke is bad for human body. I think smoking should be banned at all restaurant in the Indonesia is very good because restaurant is place foe eating so isn't delicious if other people smoking in there area. Passive smoker is very dangerous because the passive smoker can be cancer. So I agree with according above. Near can be cancer smoke can be pure because we buy cigarette but not good function and only can be we sick. So the government must be carefully with restaurant with smoking areas. Because can be use people Indonesia sick. And price cigarette must be increased because with price the cigarette increase people lazy to bought and can be reduce smoker in Indonesia. Smoke is not have many positive for people and country. Country without smoker can be beautiful country because not pollution and healthy people. I want Indonesia free from pollution because in Indonesia many pollution for example from motorcycle, car, cigarette smoke etc. And should be not banned at all restaurant, but in all place mainly place with many children in there. Because children is growth. So the children must to prevent from smoke area. I love country free pollution.
