Unlike students who work while in college. many work part time for the student if the student is fond of the job. In working part time, students also taught to work together within the existing work in the office, thus educating a student to become a good worker, because of course very different from the work. was working part time when in accordance with our interests then going to more enjoy. And most important of here after college certainly does not become unemployed again because it can work. And even if to a new job, more adaptable because it was familiar with the work. In work part time, students also get a salary from the job so that educate students to become an independent and did not bother parents. To be able to share time in study and work, the student must get rid of laziness to perform all the work. It also discipline in the division of time in study and work for all jobs run smoothly, without any obstacles so that makes a worker can perform the job well.
