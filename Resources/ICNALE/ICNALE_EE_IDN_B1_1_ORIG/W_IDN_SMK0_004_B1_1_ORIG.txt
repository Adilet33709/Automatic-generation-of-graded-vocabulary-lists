The question whether government should ban smoking in restaurant or not is a big issue. In the perfect situation, smoking policy would be manage by restaurant owner or costumers would subscribe the establishment with the policy they prefer. Customers would decide, if they want to avoid smoke-filled rooms or enter them. They might even choose to sit in an area sectioned off for smoker or non-smoker, when the government starts telling restaurant owners what their costumers can and cannot do. In my opinion, many smokers do not smell the smoke of others when they are in public place. Many years ago, people were allowed to smoke everywhere. As a result, an entire generation of elderly are experienced lung, throat, mouth, and stomach cancers that were never experienced in history before cigarettes became popular. But now, as a person, I believe in each individual person right to make choices which effect only for them. So, I will choose to stay to the restaurant that free smoking. Because, there are many disadvantage on smoking. A restaurant with smokers is not a healthy environment for people who are having their lunch or dinner. The smokers take away the right of other people to have clean air.
