I don't agree if college students have a part time job and in my opinion there are several reasons. The first reason is because it can broke focus of students in studying.

Because when students have problem, it certainly will affect on the other side. If the reason of students working to get experience, surely there must be consideration before because working and learning are the side that is difficult to put together.
