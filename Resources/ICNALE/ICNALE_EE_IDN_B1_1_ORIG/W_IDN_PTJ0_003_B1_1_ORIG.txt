I agree with it is important for college students to have a part time job. As we know, the cost for college student is too much (in this case, we can say expensive). It's easy if the parent from that students is rich people. But, how about the students with contrary condition? So, part time job its better solution for this situation. The student can help the parent to don't lost the cost too much. In the other hand, the students have new experience beside their daily activity(studying). The students must be smart to split their time. Because they add new activity for their time, studying and have a part time job. It's proudly can get their money by themselves than they must ask money from their parents as requirements in college. In my opinion, they are independent student. If all college students do that, I think the parents don't worry about financial problem. And for that student, it can be a start before they work at company after they graduate from that college. Maybe we can say its training to get a new skill for a job. So it's positive think for that student. In this era, nothing to say shine for do a something. If we can, why not? We can learn from college student who have a part time job. They get money with themselves, so they help they parents. And I think they make proud their parent with what they are doing.
