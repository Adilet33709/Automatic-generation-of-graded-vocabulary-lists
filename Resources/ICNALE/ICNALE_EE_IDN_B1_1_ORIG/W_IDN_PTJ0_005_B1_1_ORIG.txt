I was lucky enough that my parents paid for my whole college education. But I'm in line with that statement because with have a part time job we can help our parent and we have much money to buy everything we want. Beside, by doing the part job, we can get many experiences that may useful in the future. Because experience is the most important thing to get job. Moreover we can be more appreciate the money. Know that how difficult to get money. But we must can manage the time for studying and doing the part time job. Because we have to have much care about time. Everybody know that Time is Money. Managing the time is the important thing if we wont get something loss. So have part time job is important for collage student. Because many advantages that we can get from it. If we believe can do it then why not? But we have to remember that study is number one, although we have a part time job we do not lazy to studying because we can get science, experience and we can use to live in society beside as student. We have to smart to manage the time so we can take the advantages. Talk more do more and get more.
