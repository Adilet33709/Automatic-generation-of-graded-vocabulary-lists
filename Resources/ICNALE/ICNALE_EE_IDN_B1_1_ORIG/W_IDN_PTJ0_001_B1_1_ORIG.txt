Is important for college students to have a part-time job? I think that has much opinion to answer it. The part-time job is a job that can do in partial time. So the college student can do part-time job when they has spare time (if they want). There are many reasons why the college student do part-time job (if they do). The first are they need more money to having fun, pay the studying cost, etc. the second are they need to get job experiences for the future. College students need more money if they need it, because sometimes that the college student's money that given from their parent are not enough to solve it. So they will search a part-time job. Why part-time job? Because their study time can't be compromised with the regular job and they will need a part-time job that has unusual work time. So they can combine their studying with working in a part-time job. After the college students graduate from their university, it will be difficult to search a job. Because the Company that need worker will ask the job experiences related with the new job. So if they have not any experiences, they will be difficult to search job. So, job experiences from part-time job will be very helpful. I prefer to agree with the statement that college students must have a part-time job. It will give you an experiences about the future after you graduation, except if you didn't plan to work in the future.
