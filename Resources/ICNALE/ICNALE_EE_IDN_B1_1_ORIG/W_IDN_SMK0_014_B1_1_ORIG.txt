I agree with this opinion because of smoking in restaurants, can interfere with other people who were eating, and make people who are not in the mood to eat, which in because of cigarette smoke which interfere in the process of eating. besides that cigarette smoke also makes others to be a second-hand smoke that can damage health. because in these cigarettes have chemicals that can damage human health. Secondhand smoke is more dangerous than active smokers. Concentrations of nicotine dl passive smokers is greater because the poison is sucked through the cigarette smoke of active smokers are not filtered. So that makes the person can be contagious passive smokers die of substances - chemical substances that exist in cigarette smoke, which has been inhaled by humans and cannot be in the process in the body. In cigarette smoke can cause heart disease, stroke and so forth. Therefore we recommend active smokers to reduce smoking in their consumption. because cigarettes are very harmful passive smokers who get swept up in the cigarette. should the smokers to self-aware of his actions that harm others. Better to every person who smokes in restaurants be fined because it can interfere with every visitor who was eating at that place.
