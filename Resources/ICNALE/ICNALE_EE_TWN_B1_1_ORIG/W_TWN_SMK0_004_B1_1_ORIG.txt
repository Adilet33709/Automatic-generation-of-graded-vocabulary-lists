Many people hate to smoke or smell the smoke, neither do I, because it may cause our health problems and other worse outcomes. If the majority of the public dislike the smoking behavior, the government should ban this kind of deed at all the restaurants in the country. Research has found that smoking do cause the health problem, such as cancer. As we know, people who smoke can do something bad to their health. However, people who do not smoke may be affected by those who smoke in the public by inhaling the smoke, and what's worse, the possibility of having a cancer is much higher than the smoking people. It is unfair to those who do not smoke. Besides, some people think that the smell of the smoke is pretty disgust, some even vomit once they smell it. If there is no ban to restrict smoking in the public, there might be more patient to be sent to the hospital. The most important of all, when we eat at the restaurant, we hope to have the clean air, soft atmosphere and the comfortable environment. If a guy smoke in such a place, the smell is bad, and it may pollute the air, and what's worse, it may cause the taste of food going wrong, further to affect the consumer's mood. From the points of view above, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants, for the sake of the public health and the comfortable environment.
