It goes without saying that smoking do has bad influences on our bodies. If we keep smoking for a long period, we may be addicted to it as a result of the substance in the smoke named nicotine. It is possible that we are too addicted to quit smoking as we realize that smoking is such a terrible thing, unless we have the great determination and willpower to overcome all the difficulties we may meet during the time of quitting smoking. Besides this, smoking will weaken our lungs and increase the probability of suffering from lung cancer. Provided that we suffer from lung cancer, it will make not only ourselves uncomfortable but our family unhappy and worried about us as well, and the worst one is that we may even die because of it. Moreover, when smoking, we produce a kind of material which is so-called "second-hand smoke". Second-hand smoke will affect people around the smokers, making their health become bad. They may also get the same disease and consequences as smokers. To sum up, cigarette smoking is really bad for our health. As a consequence, we should never smoke no matter what kind of conditions we are in. In addition, we are supposed to persuade our family accustomed to smoking to stop doing it.
