So you just have only 7 years to learn the pro level knowledge, and choice your job which you maybe will do your whole life. If you don't study hard, you may lose the job you want. Everyone wants to do the job they want, so you can't avoid to compare with others, many company decide who they want is determined by who have more pro level knowledge. Maybe there also have several company will decide it by your part-time experience. But the most of part-time job doesn't relative the job you find. Because the company doesn't let untrained person to do the complex job. So you also couldn't get any plus from your part-time experience when you find the job. Part-time job is not bad choice when you are a student, but you should control your time well. Don't let part-time job take huge part in your life. You still have to take time to concentrate on your study. Study still should be the first in your ranking.
