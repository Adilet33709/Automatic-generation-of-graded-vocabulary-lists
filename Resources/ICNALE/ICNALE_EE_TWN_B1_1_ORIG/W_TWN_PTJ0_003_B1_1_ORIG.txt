I don't agree that it's important for college students to have a part time job, besides they must. Taiwan's education is not similar to U. S; we don't have many vary choice to choose which one we like or want to touch in school. Only in college, we choose many way to learn, even you are not major the department, you also can choose the class of other departments. In college, you can touch many vary things, and you can control what time you want to go to school except major classes. How many classes you have touched? Except major classes, you have much time to do you want to do, you might want to rest instead of in class all day, you can use the time to swim or do some sports. How long will you stay in college? General students are 4 years in Taiwan, you spend one third times of 4 years to major classes, and more than one third to other classes, the rest of time is not much to you to do anything you want to realize deeply. Sometimes, you thought money is most important to your life, but, to my opinion, learning is really the most important.
