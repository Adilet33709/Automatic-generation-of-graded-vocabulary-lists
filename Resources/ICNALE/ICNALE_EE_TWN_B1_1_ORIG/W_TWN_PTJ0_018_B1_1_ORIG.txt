I agree that is important for students to have a part-time job at college. In our country children are protect by their parents until they 18 or more than that. We don't have much time to touch the outside world. Go to college is the first time we have to deal everything ourselves, so I think it's a perfect time to make more friends, know how hard our parents earn money. You can learn a lot of thing in a part-time job, for example, if you are a clerk, you can learn how to use the cash register, the way to talk to customers. For those experience you may know how to interact with other people in a polite way. Also you can try to release some pressure of your parent, let them know you can do those thing, and they don't have to worry you. Moreover, in college we have a lot of activities, you always have to spend some money, if you want to save money, you must try to earn money, let the income more than the money you spend. Although it's important to have a part-time job, we must remember our main job is our school work. Learn how to schedule our time is another challenge. Having a part-time job can let students more independent, more responsible for their life.
