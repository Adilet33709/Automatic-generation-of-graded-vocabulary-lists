I think have part-time job experiences for students in their college life are important. In my opinions, first, most of students don't have to leave their hometown and don't have to do every thing by themselves before they become freshmen. As became a freshman, students might have to leave their hometown far for good university and parents might tell them that you should deal with everything by yourself include your costs for live. So this is definitely a good chance to training them. Second, they can learn a lot of rules and professional knowledge about the job and methods for make friends by having part-time job experience. It is useful for training them and makes their world wider. Besides, friends who known in part-time job might be important in their future. For instance, in part-time job, they might find their best friend even soul mate, and can find friends or bosses that can give a hand in their futures job as they meet some difficult. When doing part-time job or the life in the university it can be look as a little society, so before enter the real society, it can be a good chance to practice and find fault to make themselves more sophisticated. I think having part-time job experiences might make it easier and useful for students to find good jobs.
