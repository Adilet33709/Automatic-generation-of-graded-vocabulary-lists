I think government should set the rule which is no smoking in every restaurant in the country. First, smoke is not good to who is pregnant. Second, not everyone likes the smell of smoke. Otherwise, I think smoke is unhealthy active, kids maybe will learn when they saw that. The smoke also could let the restaurant into unhealthy place, because of second hand smoke. It's not a good thing for restaurant, because the consumer maybe less. Of course it's not effective policy. Because even government set that rule, the smoker could smoke outside the restaurant. But if it can make smoker less, I think it's a good situation. It also can let the restaurant's atmosphere become good. For smoker, it's a good chance to quit this unhealthy active, a lot of lung disease come from smoke. Many search can prove that. But it's not effective for the smoker. Because they rely on the smoke to less the pressure. The policy of ban the smoke just let the restaurant's consumer less. Because a lot of men want to smoke even they are eating dinner. It's unchangeable true situation. I think government should set more rule like this not only in restaurant. Try to make no-smoke society. It's difficult but it's also could make the country into good situation. Because the power of government is from people. if people doesn't have good healthy, it's not good for the country's development.
