In today's modern society, more and more students are earning for their allowances. Besides, many employers want to hire the person who has the working experience before entering into their companies. Thus, with a working experience for students is important. As we can see in the colleges, most of the students have a part-time job when they study in the school. They not only want to earn for their livings, but also accumulate their working experience. This experience especially plays an important role while writing their resumes. When they want to enter a company in the future, many employers look at the section, working experience, in the resumes. The more experience you have, the much easier you can get the entrance ticket to your favorite company. And that's the reason why the college students want to have a part-time job while studying. Take me for example, now I'm a college student, and I'm seeking for a part-time job in the summer vocation. In order to broader my working experience, I have tried many kinds of tasks which are totally different, such as a reception In the World Trade Center and a telephone caller in the cram school. In my opinion, once I have done more jobs, I would have more chance to enter into my favorite firm. By extending the working experience, it is important to have a part-time job for a college student. Moreover, once the experience accumulates, the employer would have a desire to employee you in the future!
