According to a recent study, second hand smoking does more harm to nonsmokers than to smokers. Therefore, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in the country. I'm not a smoker, and most of my friends refused to breathe second hand smoking in public places, such as school, department store and restaurant. Second hand smoking causes air pollution and makes nonsmokers feel uncomfortable. The government should pay attention to this issue. Smoking is not only harm the smokers but also does more harm to nonsmokers. While the smoker's bodies have adapted the adverse effects of smoking, non smokers don't have this advantage. Restaurants are public places that everyone can come in and go out. Second hand smoking should be banned in the restaurant, and smokers need to obey the regulations and respect nonsmokers who don't want to breathe second hand smoking. The most important thing is that our government should make laws of smoking in the restaurants. Those people who smoke in the public places such as department store, school, and restaurants should be fined. And it can also establish a team to catch smokers who smoke in the public. Thus, is the best way to protect nonsmokers away from second hand smoking.
