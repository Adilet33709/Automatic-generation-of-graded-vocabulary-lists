I have tried to work since I graduated from senior high school, not only on vacation but the time I studied for my exam. There are no other reasons just the one I am poor. I have to earn my life by looking for part-time job and doing well. Actually, my free time is almost gone. When I leave my school, I have to run to my office. I tried telephoning at cram schools or standing on the street all afternoon for distributing my dm. I have little time to join my friends' action. I left the ball team because I could not handle it. Sometimes I hated that I have to work, but now I find new fun on my part-time job. I can practice my talking skills during being a waitress, and I can be a friend with many other students like me, and I learn many experiences that I can't learn in school. However, I find my way to balance both between my school and my job. I can use my time well to do each thing. I don't think it is important for college students to have a part-time job because not everyone can handle both in his college life. But if you have the business, you can train yourself and gain achievement in different area. It's useful for your future work.
