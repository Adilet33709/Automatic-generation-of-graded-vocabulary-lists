In my opinion, I think every college students should have a part-time job during their school times. While we are in school, people always said that school is just like a small society. But if we want to learn how to socialize with people or compromise between others, get a part-time job to learn it. It's the fastest way to know how the society works. Although we may feel upset in someway, but every challenges are new opportunities to experience the society, and it makes we stronger. By the future, when we graduate from colleges, and get a full time job in other places, we will discover the frustrations that we faced before are nothing at all. Because we had known how to deal with it, and solve problems by experienced. While searching for a part-time job, there is some important information for students to know. Focus on your schoolwork and concentrate on your major courses. Don't let the job interrupt you. Part-time job is just a lesson for us to be well prepared before we enter the society, but me students can't mix them, or we may screw them up both. A job is a job, the school is the school, and we need to separate the part-time job from our schoolwork.
