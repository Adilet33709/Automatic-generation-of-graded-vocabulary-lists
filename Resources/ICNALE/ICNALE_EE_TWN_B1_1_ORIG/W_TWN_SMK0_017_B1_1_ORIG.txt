I strongly agree with the issue because I cannot endure people smoking. Sometimes I can understand why people smoking, so I don't blame them. But when I want to take a break a smell makes me distracted. It is really not a good experience. Actually, smoking is not a good habit since it does health not good. More important, it affects not only yourself but also people beside you. It can hurt your breath system and even result in lung cancer by. Your teeth may be yellower and you can't give up this habit only if you make up your mind. You want one every time when you finish your dinner, lunch, even breakfast. You specially like the feeling smoking with your "good friends". You even like to go on smoking when your parents or wife (husband) want you not do. Give up smoking is a long long journey not only for you but also for your family. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. At least, restaurants should mark a place "no smoking" for a clean eating condition. A person who smokes should know that not everybody likes the smell.
