In order to be an independent adult, we have to work in our student life. We will get much money and experience. Learning how to live in the world. For example, I had three part time job in my school life. First part time job is a guide. My work is taking Japanese tourist to go around Taipei City. I love traveling, so I enjoy the part time job. It's interested to me. Second part time job is a cram school teacher. I have to teach junior high school student geography. The work is more difficult than the first part time job. I have to promote their geography of test grade. If students don't to learn the subject, I would be disturbed by student's parents and the cram school other teachers. Not only make high geography of test grade, but also to edit new geography textbook. It's not easy to me. Third part time job is KFC's clerk. The work is a busy part time job. I have to clean tables, introduce set, and fry the chicken. I hate the job, so after 3 month I quit the part time job. Although I have some bad experience, it's still important to me. These experience abundant my life.
