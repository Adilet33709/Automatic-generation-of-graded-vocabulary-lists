I agree smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country because smoking is bad for everyone. Every year, many people died of lung cancer because of smoking. Although knowing the serious data, there are still thousands of people smoke in Taiwan and the world. Some people might say that they smoke because they feel upset or angry but I think smoking for negative mood will hurt the body more and will not be happier at all. Moreover, smoking will make environment dirty and disturb the environmental balance, too. Smoking in personal spaces might not influence other people, but it can't be forgiven to smoke in the public spaces. As in public spaces, it is important and must to respect other people. Restaurant is the place where to enjoy foods and relax, younger or elder people would go to, so I think smoking should be banned at all restaurant for everyone's health. Furthermore, I think smoking should disappear in the world that can make people healthier because health is people's best treasure and will have a big influence for people from young to old. And it is lucky that can be healthy live in clear environment. To protect our country and earth, the government should send or revise laws to keep people be healthy and maintain environment clear.
