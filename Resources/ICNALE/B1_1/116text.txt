Today, more and more college students tend to have a part-time job. Is this good or bad? As far as I am concerned, it depends on the time you spend in doing it. If you spend a proper amount of time on it, you can benefit a lot from it. Firstly, having a part-time job can enrich the student's social experiences. He will meet all kinds of people in his job and during this period, he will learn how to deal with them. This can improve his ability in communicating with others. What's more, it's not until a student makes money by himself that he learns that acquiring a living is not an easy task. In this case, he will be more understanding towards his parents and learn to manage his money properly. However, having a part-time job also has disadvantages if you spend too much time on it. Having a job means that our studying time can't be guaranteed. For us students, studying is our major duty. Once you have a part-time job, the problems in your job might prevent you from being fully absorbed in your major studies. Thus, just as each coin has two sides, taking up a part-time job has both advantages and disadvantages. It's all up to you whether you can really learn something from it.
