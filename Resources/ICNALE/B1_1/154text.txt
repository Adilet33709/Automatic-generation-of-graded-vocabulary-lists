In my opinion, I think every college student should have a part-time job during their school life. While we are in school, people always say that school is just like a small society. But if we want to learn how to socialize with people or compromise with others, we should get a part-time job. It's the fastest way to know how society works. Although we may feel upset in some way, every challenge is a new opportunity to experience society, and it makes us stronger. In the future, when we graduate from college and get a full-time job in other places, we will discover that the frustrations we faced before are nothing at all because we know how to deal with them, and solve problems from experience. While searching for a part-time job, there is some important information for students to know. Students should focus on their schoolwork and concentrate on their major courses, without interruption from the job. A part-time job is just a lesson to prepare us to enter society, but we students can't mix them, or we may screw them both up. A job is a job, the school is the school, and we need to separate the part-time job from our schoolwork.
