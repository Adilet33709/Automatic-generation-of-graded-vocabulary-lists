From my point of view, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. There are some reasons behind this opinion. First, everyone knows that smoking endangers our lives; every year there are lots of people whose deaths directly or indirectly relate to smoking, so from a health perspective, it is obvious that banning smoking in every place could effectively reduce the chance of people inhaling first-hand or second-hand cigarette smoke, which is hazardous to their body. Since most restaurants still have smoking areas available, it is still possible for customers and workers there to inhale those harmful gases. Therefore, all restaurants should ban smoking if they want to attract more people who don't want to endure anymore second-hand cigarette smoke. Second, it will give customers a bad impression if they find they smell lots of smoke in a restaurant. Then, they will have a bad image of that restaurant and stop going to that restaurant anymore. It will therefore affect the reputation of the restaurant, and the restaurant’s income will dramatically decrease. So, it is always better for restaurants to ban smoking if they want more profit. In conclusion, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants for the profit and the health of all people.
