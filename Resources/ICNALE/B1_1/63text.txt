The government should ban smoking in restaurants because smoking has many side-effects. Smoking is dangerous. The tool of smoking is the cigarette, and cigarettes contain many dangerous substances, addictive substances such as nicotine, which can damage our body system. For the active smoker, it also causes many problem to our health. They are problems with pregnancy and the fetus (for the woman), lung cancer, impotence, and many other problems. Going out from the effect of smoking, smoking in restaurants (and public areas) will disturb many people who don't smoke, who we call “passive smokers.” It is very impolite to smoke around those people, because sometimes there are people who dislike smoking very much. Those people will feel uncomfortable if there is a person smoking beside them. And it also causes the passive smoke to get the side-effects of smoking, so that problem has to be reduced. Moreover, many restaurants have air conditioners (AC) in their rooms. If there is smoke from cigarettes in the AC, it will damage the operation of AC because it needs a clean condition without any dust or smoke. That is why in many rooms with AC, smokers cannot smoke in there. So, it is important for the government to ban smoking in restaurants. And it has to be obeyed by all smokers.
