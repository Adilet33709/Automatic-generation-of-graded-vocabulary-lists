It is important for college students to have a part-time job? Are you one of the students who have a part-time job? What do you think about it? Nowadays, there are a lot of college students who have a part-time job. Some people question its importance for students. In my opinion, three major benefits of college students having a part-time job are getting work experience, saving parents' money, and using free time usefully. First, a part-time job is a way to internship. This is an important factor because in the future, when they graduate, the students must get work. If they had a part-time job before, they would do better than others would because they have more experience than others do. Experience is one of the most important factors that are necessary in a person's life. Saving parents' money is the second benefit of a part-time job. With the money that they get at a part-time job, students do not have to use their parent's money. They can help their parents reduce expenses and they can save money to use in the future. Third, nowadays most students use their free time to play games and use the internet, listen to music, etc. That is useless, but if they had a part-time job, they will use free time usefully. In conclusion, a part-time job has three benefits: it trains students for work in the future, the student can save their parents' money because they have an income, and they will change their useless free time into useful time. If Thai students can do these, how many benefits will Thailand get?
