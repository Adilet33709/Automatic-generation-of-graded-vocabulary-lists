The mission of University is to train students to be independent and have well-rounded intelligence. With this in mind, one should not neglect the training and experience provided by part-time jobs. Having a part-time job helps students learn to manage their time well and be responsible for their own duties. Some part-time jobs in particular match with students’ own field of study and may enhance their chance of learning and applying what they learn in classes. However, one should not say that a part-time job is an obligation. As some University students are supposed to be future scholars and professors in their own fields, they need to focus more on their academic work. For example, a professional scientist, mathematician, historian, or sociologist need not gain work experience. It is easy to see that professors and scholars need more advanced skills like critical thinking, methodology, and modeling to explain phenomena. On the other hand, a part-time job trains students in practical skills like document work or even manual labor. These skills have clearly no relation to some students’ future research. They could gain nothing from doing a part-time job, and lose time for their further studies and research. For them, a part-time job is just an obstacle to their success. University education is supposed to be free and student-oriented. If a student wants to have their career in practical fields or industry, they may have a part-time job to gain experience. If a student has already decided to continue to study and live with knowledge and research, a part-time job means nothing to them. Therefore, the importance of part-time jobs depend on one's ambition. It should not be regarded as 'important,' simply 'useful.'
