From my perspective, smoking ought to be completely banned at all restaurants because of the harm it does to others, particularly through air transmission and food pollution. Admittedly, for most smokers, it would certainly be enjoyable for themselves to smoke when they are having a meal, but this would be a catastrophe for others at the same restaurant. Much research has already proven that the smoke will do three times more harm to the victim who breathes smoke from the cigarettes. Being a kind of public place, restaurants are the kind of open space where once a smoker smokes, the rest of the customers will also be affected. As a result, it's obvious that smoking at restaurants will do harm to others. For the goal of protecting the health of all the customers, we should ban smoking at all restaurants. Besides the harm of the smoke, the negative effect of smoking by polluting food is something that we should also be concerned with. Apart from its harm to lungs, which is a well-known fact already, smoking hurts the smokers' stomachs as well when they are eating at the same time. During meal times, if a smoker smokes, the ash of their cigarette will drop into the food, which will eventually go into both the smoker's and the nearby people's stomachs. The stomach of human beings is unable to digest the ash from cigarettes. As a result, the stomach gets severely hurt from smoking. In sum, as we have seen the bad effects of smoking at restaurants already, it is necessary to ban smoking at all restaurants.
