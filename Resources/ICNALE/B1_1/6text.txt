Many people hate smoking and the smell of smoke, as do I, because it may cause health problems and other worse outcomes. If the majority of the public dislikes smoking, the government should ban it at all the restaurants in the country. Research has found that smoking causes health problems, such as cancer. As we know, people who smoke can badly affect their health. However, people who do not smoke may be affected by inhaling the smoke of those who smoke in public, and what's worse, the possibility of having cancer is much higher than for smokers. It is unfair to those who do not smoke. Besides, some people think that the smell of the smoke is pretty disgusting, some even vomit when they smell it. If there is no law to restrict smoking in public, more people might end up in hospital. Most importantly, when we eat at a restaurant, we hope to breathe clean air and enjoy a comfortable environment. If someone smokes in such a place, the smell is bad, and it may pollute the air, and what's worse, it may ruin the taste of the food and affect the consumer's mood. Therefore, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants for the sake of the public's health and for a comfortable environment.
