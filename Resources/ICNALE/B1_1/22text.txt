I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have two reasons to support this opinion. The first reason is for health. Under the status quo, in some restaurants, seats are divided into smoking and non-smoking areas. But even if we sit in the non-smoking area, we have to breathe smoke because it flows from one area to another. The smoke raises our risk of getting cancer. This means that it harms not only smokers, but also surrounding people. Tobacco is very bad for our health. When smoking is banned, we don't have to be afraid of breathing smoke and worry about it in the restaurant. Without health, we can't do what we want to do. Health is very important for our life. Smokers must not hurt non-smokers' health. The second reason is for us to enjoy food. Imagine, when you taste delicious food, it smells of tobacco. Then, how do you feel? Of course you pay for the food and you want to taste as much as possible, but you can't. So smoke makes you irritated and you never come to the restaurant again. What's more, the restaurant staff worked hard to cook delicious food for you. It's a very bad situation both for restaurants and customers. Like this, now, we can't fully taste food because of smoke. If smoking is banned at all restaurants, we can always just enjoy having food. We will appreciate for the food and restaurants. It's very good for the relationship between restaurants and customers. I think restaurants should be places where we mainly enjoy eating. So as not to be interrupt our enjoyment of the food, smokers should have to smoke outside. In conclusion, I think smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. This would benefit smokers, non-smokers and restaurant staff.
