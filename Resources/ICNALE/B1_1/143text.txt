Nowadays, many college students have a part-time job beside their main activity in college. A part-time job takes up half of the time in the day. College students usually do their job in their free time when they don't have any study activities. Many jobs are available in various fields such as a home teacher, shop keeper, working in a restaurant or hotel, or as an entrepreneur. Having a part-time job has many advantages for college students. College students can get a salary that can be used for many daily needs. They not only get money from their parents, but they can also buy things by themselves. For example, they can buy books that they need and pay for their school fees and other daily needs. Other advantages for college students who have a part-time job is that they can get experience. With a part-time job, college students can learn about real life, which is very important for college students. Many college students only know the theory of their study but they don't know how to apply it in the field. Indeed, many graduates are unemployed because they only know the theory of their study and they don't know the practical application of the theory. In conclusion, having a part-time job is very important for college students. They can get money by themselves, not only from their parents. Experience is another advantage of having a part-time job for college students. However, college students must manage their time between work and study.
