Actually, students don't have a lot of time to waste. Before senior high, you must learn basic theory, so you only have 7 years to learn the pro-level knowledge and choose which job you might do for your whole life. If you don't study hard, you may lose the job you want. Everyone wants to do the job they want, so you can't avoid being compared with others, as many companies decide who they want based on who has the most pro-level knowledge. Some companies will decide based on your part-time work experience, but most part-time jobs aren't related to the job you want because the company doesn't let untrained people do complex jobs. Therefore, you might not benefit from your part-time experience when you look for a job. Part-time jobs are not a bad choice when you are a student, but you should control your time well. Don't let your part-time job take up a huge part of your life. You still have to take the time to concentrate on your studies. Studying should still be your priority. Time is money; if you control your time well, you will have a lot of good experiences to enrich your life. Knowledge is the most important power for students. It's an unchangeable rule.
