As you know, smoking will make you unhealthy, grow old early, and make you die before others because cigarettes have a lot of toxins that can make you have bad health. For example, nicotine can make you get mouth cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer, and cancer anywhere that it can be absorbed, so cigarettes are not a good accessory for your life. Moreover, we have a rising number of smokers aged 15-20. It will have an effect on the country, but now we have a big problem, which is how to not allow smoking in restaurants, because smoking in these areas will make a lot of problems; it makes consumers unhappy and makes them unhealthy, too. At the same time, the merchant will have fewer benefits, too. So, this is the big problem that we need to cooperate with each other to solve. If we help each other to solve this problem it will be good for everyone, but how we can solve this problem? First, smokers should know that smoking in restaurants is not good for everyone because smokers will gain the toxins fifty percent of the time, but non-smokers will gain one hundred percent of the toxins from inhaling suddenly and the smell of cigarettes will make the taste of food go down, and because the air in the room is not good, it will make people unhappy so the smoker must concern themselves with what they should do or not before smoking. It will help everyone be happy.
