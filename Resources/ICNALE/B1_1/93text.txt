What are college students doing at school? Studying. Yes! But many would say that they are doing part-time jobs at the same time. Of course, it is of great importance! Evidently, most of us students are adults now. As an adult, it will be shameful for us to ask our parents for money. To be financially independent is the perfect way to claim that we are independent individuals now, that we are no longer kids under the protection of our parents! Secondly, and also most importantly, having a part-time job allows you to be involved in society. It allows you to find out what the people outside of school look like, how they behave, and how hard it is for us to make money to support ourselves. After going through all of the difficulties that we will encounter, we will gain a lot of experiences. When we graduate and when we next step into society, we will be confident that we are already well-prepared and that we can do it. Thus, we will learn that money is not easy to earn and that our parents are great. We ought to respect them and appreciate what they have done for us. I'm sure we will be more mature and more considerate to others. Working at part-time jobs is a way to see what life really means. Get ready to have a part-time job and try your best to prevent it from having a bad effect on your studies, and then you will be pleasantly surprised!
