It is a true statement. College students usually choose a part-time job such as a private teacher, shopkeeper, or seller. They do this job when they aren't doing anything after they have studied at university. It has many benefits for them. A part-time job can provide many useful experiences and knowledge, and more importantly, money. College students need some money to live their life without asking for money from their parents. They must begin to develop their independence to provide their necessities by themselves. As we know, students have many necessities to pay for during their studying; they have to buy something that they need in their day, such as food. They can show their families that they can do things by themselves and actively training themselves to fit into society in the future and be useful for those around them. Therefore, at a part-time job, they can show their skills that they get from their studies at university or other skills they have. It can make a creative contribution to our government. Finally, it's very beneficial for college students to have a part-time job to make them active and to get some money to fill their life.
