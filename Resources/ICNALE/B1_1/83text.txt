Smoking is a disturbing action to people because smoking is dangerous for our health. People who breathe smoke from smokers are called passive smokers. Although they don't smoke, they get the effect of smoking from a smoker. This is bad for people that often do activities near active smokers. Active smokers usually don't care that their habit is smoking. Actually, they don't want to disturb people around them with smoking, but it has already become habit to smoke at any time. I hope that active smokers can stop their habit of smoking freely without caring about other people around them in order not to disturb other people. I think all restaurants in the country should suggest to people who visit there not to smoke in the restaurant. Restaurants can put up a warning sign saying not to smoke because it can disturb other people. Smoke from cigarettes can make the restaurant environment very bad and can cause health disturbances, including cancer. So, people must be careful when doing activities near smokers. Restaurants can prepare a special room for smokers to smoke so not to disturb other people, and they can smoke freely there without a warning from other people.
