I think the government should set the rule to ban smoking at every restaurant in the country. First, smoke is not good for pregnant women. Second, not everyone likes the smell of smoke. Additionally, I think smoking is an unhealthy activity, and kids might learn to smoke if they see others smoking. The smoke also could turn the restaurant into unhealthy place, because of second-hand smoke. It's not a good thing for restaurants, because fewer consumers might go to the restaurant. Of course it's not an effective policy because, even if the government sets that rule, smokers could smoke outside the restaurant. But if it can lessen the number of smokers, I think it would be a good situation. It also can improve the restaurant's atmosphere. For smokers, it's a good chance to quit this unhealthy activity, as it causes lung disease. Much research proves that. But it's not effective for the smoker because they rely on smoking to reduce the pressure. The policy of banning smoking might reduce the amount of consumers at the restaurant because a lot of men want to smoke, even when they are eating dinner. It's an unchangeable but true situation. I think the government should set more rules like this not only in restaurants. They should try to make a non-smoking society. It's difficult but it could also put the country into a good situation because the power of the government is from the people. If people aren't healthy, it's not good for the country's development.
