Jobs for students. We buy things with money, so it is the basic need of man. We do many things for the sake of money; without money, it is impossible to acquire anything. Education is very expensive in our country, and we cannot get an education without money; therefore, a student is always busy searching for a good and respectable job. It is an essential need for students. A great problem of our country is that the opportunities for jobs are very few and the working hours are not set according to hard work and labour. A student wants the type of job where he spends little time on the job and gets a handsome income in return for his work, but it is not possible for him. The employers of every field want more work in return for a small income or salary. We have two ways, either make education free for everyone or produce good jobs for students to cover the cost of their education. It is the government’s responsibility to think about this huge problem; the government should provide the funds for education and for poor students. Students are the future of the nation; if we do not pay attention to this problem, we will lose our future.
