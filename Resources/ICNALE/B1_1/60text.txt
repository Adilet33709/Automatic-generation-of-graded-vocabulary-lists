Are earning money and experience important for us? I think all University students should have to find a part-time job. Not just for the money, but also for the future. First of all, every university student has to play $42,100 every year. This is a very big deal for lower-income families. Having a part-time job can help alleviate these families' burden. For me, I come from a poor family. It is hard for my family to pay the money required. Although the wages for part-time jobs are not high enough, there is no doubt that it can help lessen the total amount. Secondly, a university graduate cannot fit all the requirements that employers ask for. We can learn from experiences doing part-time jobs, for example communication skills through interactions with clients or other useful skills. This is a prerequisite for getting a well-paying job and it just makes life happier. To conclude, having a part-time job has many benefits, so it is highly recommended. Just find a job now!
