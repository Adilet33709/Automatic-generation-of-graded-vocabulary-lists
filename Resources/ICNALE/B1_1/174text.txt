Smoking is a bad habit. It is a form of drug like heroin, but it is not a pure form of drug. People first smoke it for fun with friends but it becomes a habit. The addiction to smoking becomes a part of them. The smoke which is emitted from a cigarette is very dangerous for our health. The smoker is affected directly because he takes the smoke in but the people living with him are also affected indirectly. The smoke which he emits from his mouth and from the cigarette is very dangerous for other people also. There are some abnormalities in the children of those smokers which are not observed at a younger age but can be observed when they grow older. When the smokers go to any restaurant and start smoking, the other people who are not use to this smell feel annoyed. Some people are allergic to the smell. The smell becomes part of the food. Some people feel nauseous because of the smell. So, smoking should be banned in restaurants. The advertisements should be banned, and cigarettes should be banned in shops. The younger generation is spoiled by the bad habit of smoking. It's after effects are miserable. There are many institutions who are working to stop it. We should help the people who are addicted to smoking because smoking causes skin cancer, lung cancer, TB, heart diseases. PREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CURE.
