It is very common to see men smoking in restaurants in China. If you fall into the habit of smoking, it will be very hard for you to unlearn it. As is known to all, smoking really does harm to our health. Cigarettes contain a lot of nicotine, which are harmful. Many heavy smokers get lung cancer after having smoked for a period of time. Smoking not only does harm to the smoker himself, but also has a bad effect on the health of the people around. This is called "second-hand smoking," and it is very harmful to the public’s health. In the restaurant, when people are having meals, if other people smoke around them, their health will be affected. Smoking also influences the moods of people nearby. If someone is smoking in a restaurant when we are eating, we will feel annoyed and lose our appetite. Therefore, smoking should be banned completely at all restaurants in the country, but of course can be allowed somewhere else. Our government should do something to support this suggestion, such as implementing some laws and rules. More importantly, we ourselves should try our best to obey the laws and rules. Then the health of our people will improve greatly.
