I agree with the statement because I hate smoking while I am eating a meal. Smokers have the right to smoke, but non-smokers also have the right not to smoke at the same time. But the non-smoker's right is lighter than smoker's. Smokers can smoke almost everywhere at any time. Despite the fact that smokers can control their desire for a short time like during class, if they want to smoke, they can go to a smoking place soon after eating a meal. It is hard for a non-smoker to say “don’t smoke” to them, and non-smokers have non-smoking places. Smoking causes many diseases like cancer, heart diseases, etc. Even smokers don't want to have these diseases. They don't want to get sick and are afraid of death after falling ill. But people don't stop smoking. One reason is the Japanese environment. People can get cigarettes easily and cheaply and can smoke almost everywhere. The Japanese government hasn’t forbidden smoking. They don't try to reduce smoking rates or announce that smoking is dangerous for one's health. If smoking was completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, smokers would lose one chance, one place for smoking, and some smokers may quit smoking. It would be evidence that smoking is bad for one's health so the government banned it, and non-smoker could enjoy their meals.
