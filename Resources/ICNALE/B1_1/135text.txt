It is important for college students to have a part-time job. When we talk about part-time jobs, I usually think about the jobs on the internet that are not safe in things such as employers, tasks, or processing of work and money. I think this because when working  a part-time job we doesn't know the employer. However, a part-time job doesn't only mean a job on the internet but it means any job from anywhere. I think that a part-time job is important to many people while it is also not important to many people. In the case of college students I think it is not important to have a part-time job because we have pocket money from our parents. Therefore, it not necessary to have a part-time job, but I don't mean that a part-time job is not good. I think that it is very necessary for many college students also because we must not forget that most college students are poor. Therefore, they need to have a part-time job to get more money to pay for daily life, and it is very necessary for them. In conclusion, I think it depends on how necessary it is to work a part-time job, and that it is a very personal thing to do.
