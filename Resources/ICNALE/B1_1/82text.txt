Millions of people die every year from lung cancer caused by smoking. Many countries prohibit smoking in public areas. However, some people without discipline still smoke in public areas, even if they know that it is prohibited. Smoking in public places such as restaurants, bars, and cafes must be banned. Restaurants are places for eating and not for smoking. People who smoke in restaurants affect other people who are not smoking, called second-hand smokers, who suffer most from inhaling cigarette smoke. We all know that many people smoke nowadays, so it's common to see people smoking everywhere they go. Some smokers don't agree with banning smoking in restaurants or even bars, but they should also consider the health of others. They should be considerate of the people who do not smoke, and of people who have lung problems such as asthma. Many people today are dying because of the lung cancer caused by smoking and/or second-hand smoke. People that smoke know the risks of smoking and second-hand smoke, and therefore they should be aware where and when it is appropriate to smoke and where and when it is not. Therefore, I agree with the banning of smoking in public places. A smoker's choice should not affect the health of others. People should be able to enjoy public places without being subjected to smoke. The right to smoke does not mean smokers can subject others to their harmful smoke. People say that they have the freedom to smoke if they want to but they are forgetting people have the freedom to live, which smokers take away from them. Smokers should respect this policy, not only by obeying the law but also to set good example for the younger generations.
