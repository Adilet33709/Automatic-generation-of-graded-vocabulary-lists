Most teenagers want to make money without supporting their parents. In my case I could gain lots of advantages when I worked in a part-time job. First of all, I could make different kinds of relationships. As you know, if we enter new circumstances, we can meet many people. Every people makes you learn valuable things, whether you like each person or not. Second, I could gain good skills from a part-time job. If you work in a restaurant kitchen, you could learn to cook well. Also, if you work in an apparel store in a department store, you could give people good service and could match clothes well depending on each situation or purpose. Finally, you can learn how valuable money is and how to deal with money well. If you take money from your parents, you just waste money easily. However, if you earn money for yourself to buy something, you couldn't use your money easily and would think very carefully when you decide to spend it. Through my experiences, if you have an opportunity to work in a part time job, you can gain economical and social advantages in your life.
