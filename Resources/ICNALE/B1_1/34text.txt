The students of college or university are teenagers. They are responsible for everything. After already studying, they have a part time job. Therefore, they should have an activity. Something may be bad or good but you know what? It is interesting, because it is experience. It is outside of your class. You learn something. A job is a good activity because you get strange experiences and you can make money. My opinion about part time jobs for students is that the government should support them very much because it is a good activity. They spend time in a good way and get many benefits like learning about social relationships, taking care of other people, knowing what other people want, trying to serve them happily, etc. It is a process of training students to be adults. They will learn from the managers and friends in the workplace. For example, if a customer complains about the company, how do they deal with it? Some customers may be unkind and ask for many things. It helps with how to keep patient and try to calm down. When trying to calm down, they must know solutions. Therefore, I think students, when they have a part time job, can be like adults learning how to work and deal with people.
