Many university students have part-time jobs. There are many different opinions about part-time jobs. Some parents think having part-time jobs can affect the students' study, therefore their children are not allowed to have part-time jobs. Others think that having a part time job is a good social experience. Many students think that they can learn useful skills through various part-time jobs. If you work in a supermarket, you can learn how to promote products. If you are computer savvy, you can make homepages for additional cash. Also, you will learn how difficult it is to earn money, then you will be more willing to study and save money. I believe it is necessary for students to have a part-time job for their future. Most of all, encouraging students to participate in a part-time job may be beneficial for their future success. To be more specific, students will gain experience of what is like to live throughout adult society, which means that they will be prepared for their future as they grow up. Moreover, encouragement for students to participate in a part-time job will be positive for their future. In particular, participating in a part-time job will not only give experiences but they also will gain money, which they can spend on things such as clothing. In addition, they will feel a great sense of accomplishment that they bought things with their own money. So I agree with the statement.
