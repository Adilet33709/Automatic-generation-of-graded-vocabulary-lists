I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because smoking is bad for everyone. Every year, many people die of lung cancer because of smoking. Despite knowing the serious data, there are still thousands of people who smoke in Taiwan and around the world. Some people might say that they smoke because they feel upset or angry, but I think smoking to improve a negative mood will hurt the body more and will not make anyone happier. Moreover, smoking pollutes the environment and disturbs the environmental balance. Smoking in personal spaces might not influence other people, but it is unforgiveable to smoke in public spaces, as it is important to respect other people. Restaurants are places where people go to enjoy food and relax, younger and older people go too, so I think smoking should be banned at all the restaurants for everyone's health. Furthermore, I think smoking should disappear from the world to make people healthier, because health is a person's best treasure and has a big influence on all people, from young to old. It is lucky to be healthy and live in clean environment. To protect our country and Earth, the government should send or revise laws to keep people healthy and maintain a clean environment.
