It is important for college students to have part time jobs. I have two reasons why. One reason is to make money. College students have much free time compared with other members of society. Adults often say, “I have money but no time.” As college students, we can do what we want to do as far as time permits. Therefore, we need money. The other reason is to have many opportunities through part time jobs. Part time jobs enable us not only to make money but also to make friends, have a sense of responsibility, learn manners, and so on. As for me, I have had a part time job and worked at a doughnut shop for 3 years. I work from 5:00 to 9:00 and go to school twice or three times a week. Since I started my part time job, I have changed. For example, I come into contact with a wide range of people from children to old people through my part time job. I have learned how to talk with a range of people. This skill has helped me in job interviews. Consequently, I received an informal job offer. In addition, I sometimes travel using the money I have earned. I have been to India, Australia, South Africa, and so on. I had invaluable experiences in these places. I couldn't get such experiences by relying on pocket money from my parents. But there is one thing that I must not forget. The main work for students is not their part time job but study. So students must hold a part time job so that the job doesn't interrupt their study.
