For me, it is up to the student if he/she wants to have a part-time job, as long as his/her priority is studying and learning. A part-time job can help you to finish your studies without the help of your parents, and it can also help you to become more responsible in balancing your time between your studies and job. This will also help you to build your priorities in life and focus on your goals. Yet, some of my friends have stopped studying and started to work as full-time employees, because they have enjoyed the not-so-high salary they received every month. They just kept saying, “What is the purpose of studying if I already earn money for myself”. They say these words without realizing that an education is one of the requirements for having a good job and maybe to be promoted if your part-time job is related to your course. The point is, you should be flexible, open-minded, and focus on what your main goal in life is so that your chances of achieving it are very high. Lastly, I think the most important thing is your inspiration, like a family member, friend, or special someone, or your dreams that motivate you to continue achieving your goal.
