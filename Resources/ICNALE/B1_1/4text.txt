Imagine that you are enjoying your delicious meal when clouds of smoke surround you and a heavy smoker, whose breath smells of tobacco, speaks out right beside you. How will you feel at this moment? How will you feel about this place? You would certainly lose your appetite and intend to escape from the man as soon as possible, wouldn’t you? For me, I think that under no circumstances should smoking be allowed in public places, such as the restaurant. The reasons are as follows. First of all, it does no good for your health. Both the smokers and the second-hand smokers are risking their health, even their lives, on cigarettes. Every year, large amounts of people die of lung cancer just because of smoking too much. Everyone should realize that our life is really precious and that it is our duty to value it. Therefore, stay away from cigarettes not only for yourself but also for others around you. Secondly, it is a bad behavior or habit for our adolescents to imitate. Smoking in front of others is bad manners; it not only makes an awful impression on others' minds but also misleads children in regarding it as an acceptable or even cool action. Every adult should be mentally alert to set a good example, especially in public places. In other words, let's create a smoke-free atmosphere to enjoy our meal. Seriously speaking, no smoking at any restaurant in the country!
