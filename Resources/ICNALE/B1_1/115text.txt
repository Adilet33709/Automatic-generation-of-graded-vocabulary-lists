I think having part-time job experiences for students in their college life is important. In my opinion, first, most students don't have to leave their hometown and don't have to do everything by themselves before they become freshmen. When they become a freshman, students might have to leave their hometown to go to a good university and parents might tell them that they should deal with everything by themselves including living costs. So this is definitely a good chance to train them. Second, they can learn a lot of rules and professional knowledge about the job and methods for making friends by having part-time job experiences. It is useful for training them and making their world wider. Besides, friends who they meet in their part-time job might be important in their future. For instance, they might find their best friend, or even their soul mate, and friends or bosses that can give a hand in their future job when they meet some difficulties. When doing a part-time job, the life in university can be looked at as a little society, so before entering the real society, it can be a good chance for students to practice and find ways to make themselves more sophisticated. I think having a part-time job experiences might be useful and make it easier for students to find good jobs.
