Yes, it is important for college students to have a part-time job because they will learn how to manage their time in their studies and work. A part-time job really provides a lot of help to parents who give us the money to pay our tuition fees and monthly allowance. If you have to work, you will learn the importance of money, and some students will be able to use their own savings for their everyday expenses. You will able to distinguish if you really need to buy something or not, and be able to restrain yourself from buying things which are not important because you will know that they are just a waste of your money and time. For example, if your professor gives you a thesis writing task, you will be able to print the pages you need in hardcopy. Rather than asking your parents, you can instead use your own money for the project to accomplish the task that the professor has given to you. You will also take responsibility for being both a student and employee. We all know that a part-time job is not an easy task.
