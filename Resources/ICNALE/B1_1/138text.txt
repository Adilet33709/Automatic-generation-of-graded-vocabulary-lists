Smoking is the most common activity that has been adopted by our youth and adults. It causes serious damage to the brain, lungs and many other body parts. Once a person is addicted to it, it is very difficult for him to shake it off. Although this should be banned everywhere, it should be strictly prohibited in public places, especially in restaurants. Restaurants are the most common public places. There is no fresh air in restaurants to carry away the smoke of the cigarettes and other things that smokers usually smoke. Everyone has an idea of the damage that is caused by smoking, but still a great majority of people have become victims of smoking and have spoiled their lives. The smoke pollutes the atmosphere with its various ingredients like nicotine and tar. Research has proved that smoking causes lung cancer not only in the smokers itself but also the people by whom he is surrounded because smoke makes its way through the nostrils into the lungs of those people. Therefore, when a person smokes in a restaurant, he not only harms himself but also others around him, then he pollutes the atmosphere and the food. This kind of food is no less than poison. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the administration of the restaurant and each and every one of us to do our best to stop this rising destruction.
