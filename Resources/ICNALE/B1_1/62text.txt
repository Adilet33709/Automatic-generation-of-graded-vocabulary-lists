Whether smoking should be banned at all restaurant is a controversial issue in this territory. There are both pros and cons of this policy. For me, I am one of the ban’s advocates. In this essay, I would like to share my view on the benefits of the policy. To start with, implementing a smoking ban can improve the working conditions of the catering and service workers, reducing the time they are exposed to the second-hand smoke of the customers. That's to say, the smoking ban can help protect the health of the workers, lowering their chances of suffering from respiratory diseases and even lung cancer. What's more, the health of the general public can also be safeguarded. It is very dangerous that non-smokers always have to suffer from the second-hand smoke of smokers, especially for pregnant women and small children because their immunity is weaker. Thus, if the smoking ban is put into force, their health can also be protected. More importantly, the policy can improve the reputation of Hong Kong as a clean city. With fewer people smoking in Hong Kong, the air quality will certainly become better, so Hong Kong will become a more attractive city for tourists. As a result, the general image of Hong Kong as an international and healthy city will be promoted further. Conclusively speaking, there are many benefits of this policy. By prohibiting smoking at all restaurants, I am convinced our citizens' health and city's image can be improved.
