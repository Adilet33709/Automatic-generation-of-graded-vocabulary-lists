In today's modern society, more and more students are earning their allowances. Besides, many employers want to hire people who have work experience before entering their companies. Thus, work experience for students is important. As we can see in the colleges, most of the students have a part-time job when they study. They not only want to earn their living, but also accumulate work experience. This experience is important for writing their resumes. When they want to enter a company in the future, many employers look at the section on work experience in the resumes. The more experience you have, the easier it is to enter your favorite company. And that's the reason why college students want to have a part-time job while studying. Take me for example, now I'm a college student, and I'm seeking a part-time job for the summer vacation. In order to broaden my work experience, I have tried many kinds of tasks which are totally different, such as a receptionist at the World Trade Center and a telephone caller in a cram school. In my opinion, once I have done more jobs, I will have more chance to enter my favorite firm. To extend the work experience, it is important for a college student to have a part-time job. Moreover, once the experience accumulates, the employer is more likely to employee you in the future!
