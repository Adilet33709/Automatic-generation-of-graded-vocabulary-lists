Nowadays, our world is very polluted, which causes people's health to decline every day. Smoking is one of the causes of air pollution and has no good effect on anything. It also makes a bad atmosphere with smoke everywhere it occurs, especially when smoke travels in restaurants where many people can eat and talk to each other joyfully. From my point of view, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. First of all, smoking is the easiest way to destroy users and people around them. I have no idea why smokers want to harm themselves, but I think that no one wants to stand near smokers and inhale a lot of pollution into their lungs. There are many people dying every day because of disease from tobacco smoke. Another reason is that restaurants are public places that everyone can come into. There are people who hate the smoke from tobacco very much. It is extremely impolite to make them irritated and destroy a good atmosphere in a restaurant by your smoking. Finally, I strongly believe that no one wants to see smokers in restaurants because they need to dine with happiness and nobody has the right to disturb their enjoyment.
