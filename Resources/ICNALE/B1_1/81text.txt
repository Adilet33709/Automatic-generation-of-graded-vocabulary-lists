As important as anything to study at university, I think it's important to have a part-time job during one's college life. So far we do not have much experience, especially of social life. However, through part-time job experiences, we can learn the routines of social life. Through various part-time jobs we may gain a lot of experiences. First is the first career. The second is to find a solution to your problems. Here we will be able to raise our own independence. The third is vocational aptitude, which bridges what you want to be and what you are not fit for yet. Therefore, through part-time job you can learn what you want to be, and you can choose to become that. Part-time rather than irregular work, but more working in a field related to a desired future profession is recommended. The reason being, a part-time job is not just a means of making money; it is a step toward one's future. Recognizing the importance of college credits and a part-time job, and working hard for your college life will be better to live without regrets.
