As college students, we are responsible for our lives. We have to work for an income ourselves. That is why we need a part-time job so much. We have classes and need to study most of the time. We could do a full-time job, but the problem of living costs still need to be solved. To solve this problem, finding a part-time job is a good way. Summer vacation is coming. It is a hot time that many people want to find part-time jobs, especially students, because we now have more free time to work. If we make good use of the summer vacation, we can have extra money to use from a part-time job. Part-time jobs have some advantages for us. First, we don't have to throw all of our time into it. For most jobs, you just need to choose some period that you can go to work. Second, you can learn more new things and skills, most importantly, and also the ordinary reason we want to get a part-time job, is that we can earn some money. However, finding a part-time job also has some bad parts. One is that the salary is very little. Sometimes the employer may take students as free workers. The pay isn't equal to the amount we work. The other is that there are plenty of illegal jobs nowadays. If we don't pay full attention and find jobs carefully, we may break the law. So finding a part-time job isn't an easy thing and we must be careful.
