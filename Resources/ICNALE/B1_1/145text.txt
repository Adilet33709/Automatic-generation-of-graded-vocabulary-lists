In college, students want to find something to do to have new experiences and money. There are many things to do and the best one is a part time job. It is good for students to have a part time job because it will make the students get more experiences, students will earn money, and they may have opportunities to get a job in future. First, it is good for students to have part time jobs because students will get more experiences. When students have to do their jobs, they will face many situations with consumers and their boss. They will have more patience and learn more about living with others in society. Second, students will earn more money while they are learning. Part time jobs make money for students too. Students will know the value of money and how hard they must work to find it. From this, they will know how to use money and they will have money if they have to use it. Finally, another reason why it is good for students to have a part time job is they might get more opportunities to work in the future. If students work, they will meet many people. In addition, if the agency finds that this student is good at working, they can remember their name and promise this student the job when they graduate. All in all, students might strongly believe that doing a part time job is necessary and important because a part time job can give more experiences, make money, and provide more opportunities for students in the future.
