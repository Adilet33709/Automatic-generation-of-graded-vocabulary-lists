These days, university fees are expensive. So, I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. First, students have grown up depending on the assistance of their parents. You should make your own pocket money and cover your own university fees by having a part-time job. Naturally, it is difficult to concentrate on your university major and it is tiring to sleep less because of your job. Your immune system may become weak, so you may become sick, but not everybody's parents are rich. So, students should have a part-time job. Second, a part-time job is a kind of social life. Therefore, students experience social life and after they graduate from university, it is important to experience social life. Naturally, university life is a kind of social life, but it is different to having a part-time job. Last, by having a part-time job, you can realize the value of money. If one student does not have a part-time job and another student does have a part-time job, their attitude toward money will be different. The student without a part-time job does not realize value of money. The student with a part-time job buy will think about spending their money before buying something. I think I agree that it is important for college students having a part-time job.
