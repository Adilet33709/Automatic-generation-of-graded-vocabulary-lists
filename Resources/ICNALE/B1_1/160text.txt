I somewhat disagree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. As is well known, smoking is a killer of humans' health, does great harm to our respiration systems, and finally makes our bodies weak. To make matters worse, most healthy people dislike the smell of smoking, which concerns not only the citizens but also the whole impression of the restaurant. So we could safely come to the conclusion that smoking is harmful to everyone eager for health and honor, except for the factories making cigars and  the like. However, even though smoking is hateful, we'd better say that we should try to control it rather than ban it, or we would be subjective. For one thing, some people here couldn't give it up right away, for smoking is the comfort in their lives. It's possible that if one could live longer without happiness, one might prefer to choose a shorter life with happiness. Thus, we shouldn't take away people's happiness at the moment until we find something else to replace it with and they are willing to accept it. For another, restaurants are places where citizens experience life and relax themselves. Many are accustomed to smoke there. As we see, having a smoke in an ordinary restaurant is like a function of the restaurant itself. From the above, we come to understand that smoking should not be completely banned in restaurants in the country. Instead, we might try to find other ways to improve the environment in which we live. For example, there could be restaurants and other public places made especially for smoking, where you could smoke as you like without any limitation.
