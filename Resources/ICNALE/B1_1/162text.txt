People argue about whether students should have a part-time job; some think it makes people learn something, like society skills and speaking skills, but others think that it compresses the time that students need to study. I started my part-time job after I graduated from junior high school; that was the first time I got money from a job. I was so happy that I spent it very quickly; I bought clothes and food. I felt very satisfied, but the more people have, the more unsatisfied the heart becomes. So I felt unhappy when I had spent all my money. My best friend, Cindy, works at a part-time job every day. Her life is work, work, and work. When we have a group report, she usually can't do it with us, but it is important to attend our class, so we became unhappy and told her that it's not right. If the thing she learned in college is just work, and she ignores her friends, studies, grades, and future, it's like putting the cart before the horse. Now we don't do reports with her anymore. It is no use crying over spilt milk even if she regrets it. Maybe a part-time job can make one more and more wise, but it can let one lose one's college life. I think college time is more precious than anything. If you haven't enjoyed the time at college, it's very unfortunate.
