Yes, it should be banned because restaurants are establishments for people who want to eat, not smoke. Smoking should be banned, not only in restaurants, but I think in all public places. Smoking is almost as bad for people who do not smoke because if they go out to a restaurant they would be able to smell the smoke coming from smokers. Smoking is dangerous to our health, it can cause many kinds of illnesses that can affect our body and cause death. Also, due to smoking, many innocent people who are not smokers are affected, and I think that second-hand smoking is worse for them than for the person who is smoking. Now, I think there are already a law stating that if you're caught smoking in public places, someone will arrest you and you will pay a penalty. I think if we collect the money that will otherwise go to buying cigarettes, we will collect more money that can be donated instead being spent on cigarettes. In this way, our health will not be in danger, and most of all, we will help other people through the small amounts of money donated.
