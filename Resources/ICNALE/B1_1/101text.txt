I think that smoking should be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country for several reasons. Cigarettes have a lot of bad effects on both smokers and non-smokers. First, restaurants are places that everyone enjoys eating and talking with his or her friends. Everyone should be happy in restaurants. Smokers may be happy to smoke. But non-smokers must be not happy, because even if they don't smoke, they have to breathe cigarette smoke. Even there is only one smoking person, the smoke spreads all over the room in restaurants. In my case, I don't like smoke and the smell of cigarettes, so if someone smokes in restaurants, I don't want to eat there. Second, smoking during eating is not good manners. At least during eating, smokers should stop smoking. Non-stop smoking is not only bad manners, but can also become a killer. This means that cigarettes may lead to diseases in both smokers and non-smokers. The disease of particular concern is cancer. Cancer is one of the more difficult diseases, because it often reappears, and if the cancer is too bad, the person may die. As you know from these examples, cigarettes give only bad effects to people. That is why I think that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.
