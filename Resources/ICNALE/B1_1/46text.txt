As a college student, I think having a job or part-time job is difficult while you are studying. If you have a job at the same time as you are studying, it's like cutting your body in half, meaning you have to split your attention in two and focus on work, tasks, and other things. Being a working student, your time is reduced, and you lose your focus on some things. I don’t think that there shouldn’t be working students, I only think that having to work at the same time as studying is difficult, so I salute working students. There are a disadvantages and advantages to being a working student. One disadvantage, as I said earlier, is that your time is reduced. One advantage is that you can help yourself in terms of studying at the same time as helping your family. Being a working student is so challenging because you need to balance your time. It is a matter of time management and discipline and of multiplying your time rather than dividing it. For me, if you are a working student you should try to enjoy everything because every moment is a remarkable learning experience. Through such experiences, you can not only hear from others the way working students are, but to be actually listening and being with each other in our daily work.
