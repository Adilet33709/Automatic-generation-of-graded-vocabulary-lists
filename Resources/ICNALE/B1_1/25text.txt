College is the highest place to receive a formal education. Because college students are required to study in college, they should not have a part-time job so they can graduate with a better grade. If they have a part-time job, they will not focus on their lectures, but every semester, students at university have many lectures worth about 24 credit points, which is about 11 lectures. It will disturb the students learning if they have a part-time job because a part-time job will disturb the student's mind and stop them from focusing on their lectures. They will not have much time to do their assignments. We know that lectures start in the morning and finish in the afternoon. I believe the students will feel tired because they get many lectures from Monday until Friday. Of course, the lecturer will guess the students' assignments. The students that have part-time jobs will not know about problems in their college. The function of a student is as a stick holder of our beloved country. If the students did not know the problems in their college or know how to solve them, I cannot imagine what our beloved country or our colleges will be like in the future. I think college students should not have a part-time job because they will not focus on their lectures, they will do not many assignments, and they will not know about the problems in their college.
