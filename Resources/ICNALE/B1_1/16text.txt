I don't think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. This is because that smokers have the right to do what they want to do, as other people who are not smokers also have this right. Of course, I disagree that smokers should smoke whenever and wherever they want to. And I also disagree that smokers should be smoking when they are walking or working. Some people who think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country may say that smoking is very harmful and bad for the health of the smoker and the people around him, and I think that they are right. In fact, I don't like smokers very much. But I think that completely banning smoking at all the restaurants in the country is too strict for smokers. I also think that a complete smoking ban in restaurants is not fair for smokers. So, I think that at least some spaces where smokers can smoke freely should be made at all the restaurants in the country. This is why I don't think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
