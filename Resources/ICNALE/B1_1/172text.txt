A part-time job is very important for fulfilling the requirements. It's also good for the practical life; students learn how to deal with the markets, how to work in the markets, and they get experiences under senior persons and achieve respect. It is good for students to get information. On the one hand, it has benefits such as experience, money and respect, but on the other hand, it has some problems that affect their studies. If students work late at night at their part-time job, it affects their health and their studies. They cannot concentrate fully on their studies. Sometimes the situation is so critical that the one who wants to study and setup his life has to start a part-time job to do so. There are many examples of students who want to study at colleges and universities. Their situation forced them to do a part-time job and even sometimes the money from only one part-time job does not fulfil the requirements, so they have to do two jobs at a time. One after the college or classes and another late at night. The advancements of technology mean that, on the one hand, the technology can be used for relaxation and advancements, but on the other hand, these advancements are too costly.
