Cigarette is made of hazardous materials to be used by people. The composition of a cigarette includes a filter and manufactured tobacco. When they are smoked, many hazardous materials appear in the smoke, but the Filter gets rid of toxic material and it gives smokers  less toxic smoke. The toxic materials in cigarette smoke have lots of kinds, e.g., nicotine, tar, CO, etc. They cause critical damage to the human body. The lungs, in particular, are damaged by smoke. If humans smoke cigarettes, the smoke get into the lungs and causes cancer. But this danger is greater for non-smokers than for smokers, because non-smokers inhale the toxic materials without a filter. For this reason, smoking has a bad effect for non-smokers. Many people who divide into non-smokers or smokers are gathered in restaurants and public places in the country. At the restricted place, non-smokers will inhale toxic material against their wishes. So, the action of smoking in restaurants or public places has bad effects for non-smokers. They are exposed to a greater death rate than smokers for passive smoking. In conclusion, because of this dangerous effect, smoking - which damages our health - should be restricted for the health of non-smokers at restaurants and in public places.
