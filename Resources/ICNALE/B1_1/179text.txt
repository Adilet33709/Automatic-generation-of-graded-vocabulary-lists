I think working part time is very important for students because they can divide their time between study and work. Unlike many students who work while in college, some students work part time if they are fond of the job. By working part time, students learn to work together within the office, thus educating them to become good workers, because of course it is very different from studying. Working a part-time job that is in accordance with our interests will be more enjoyable. And most importantly, after college, we will certainly not become unemployed again because we can work. And even if we have to get a new job, we are more adaptable because we are familiar with working. When they work part time, students also get a salary from the job, so that educates students to become independent and not to bother their parents. To be able to share time between study and work, the student must get rid of their laziness to perform their work and learn how to discipline themselves so they can divide their time between work and study and work so that all jobs run smoothly, without any obstacles; that makes a worker perform the job well.
