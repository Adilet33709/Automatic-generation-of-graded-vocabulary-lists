Today, the proportion of people who smoke is greater every day, and there is a higher rate of people who suffer because of people who smoke. The Thai government and other associations find the solution to be to reduce smoking. For example, the Thai government released a new campaign to reduce the smoking areas in Thailand by banning people from smoking in restaurants. From this, it shows that smoking is the biggest problem that influences health, the environment, and the personality of the person who smokes. Firstly, smoking is not good because it damages our health. In cigarettes, there are many toxic chemicals that can damage your lungs. Moreover, according to  research, smoking is more dangerous to the people who inhale it than to the people who smoke. Many people have to suffer from lung and heart disease, and for some people, we have to open their windpipe and attach a pipe to help that person breathe. Secondly, smoking makes people lose their good personality. People who smoke will have black lips and become thinner. Smoking will make people ill and unhealthy, and then they will look bad, lose their good qualities, and look worse as a result. Finally, smoking is not good because it creates a bad environment. The smoke from cigarettes has an awful smell and makes the area have a bad smell too. The smoke has toxic chemicals, which causes diseases in people. In addition, it is harmful for plants and other living things too. Many plants around the smoking area will become unhealthy and die. All in all, to solve this problem the government should start more campaigns and laws to protect people who do not smoke from people who smoke in public areas or in restaurants to keep people from being victims of the dangers of smoking.
