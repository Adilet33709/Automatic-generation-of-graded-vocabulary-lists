I very much agree with this statement. Don't you think it is very annoying when you are eating happily with your family or your friends, and then there is some smoke and bad smells that come suddenly to your table? I don't understand why people smoke. Smoking only affects people in a lot of bad ways, especially in terms of their health. Smoking is a cause of many diseases of the lungs, throat, mouth, and heart. Even if you smoke only one time, you will have more risk of getting lung cancer and heart disease. Not only smokers have this risk, but people around the smoker have the risk too. It is sad that the people who receive smoke from the smoker, called 'second-hand smokers,' have a higher risk than the smokers themselves! I think every smoker knows the bad things about smoking and knows that he or she will hurt their loved ones. Then why do some still smoke? I think we should ban all smoking in public places, not only in restaurants, and we must do it legally. If smoking is bad for everybody, why do we still keep it in our country? Why we don't stop them and have better health?
