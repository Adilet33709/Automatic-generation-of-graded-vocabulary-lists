Many people like smoking, but I think it's very bad behavior. It is easy to buy tobacco at convenience stores. Even though the staff will ask you to show your credentials, it hasn't reduced the amount of smokers. Smoking will make people unhealthier. A heavy smoker's probability of getting cancer is higher than non-smokers. It's harmful to our bodies. Even though the box of tobacco may print the pictures of people with cancer, heavy smokers don't care about it. The most important thing to them is the tobacco. I hate the smell of tobacco; it makes me short of breath, so I am grateful that no one smokes in my family. They don't harm themselves. My older brother told me when he was in army that someone tried luring him to smoke, but he refused, because he thinks health is the most important thing in the world, and the smell of tobacco is not good. I think smoking should be banned in public places, because not everyone can accept the uncomfortable smell. If every heavy smoker smoked in the public street, we would smell it in every corner, but it's harmful to our bodies.
