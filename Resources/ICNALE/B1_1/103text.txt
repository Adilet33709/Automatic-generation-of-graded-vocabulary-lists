The question whether the government should ban smoking in restaurants or not is a big issue. In the perfect situation, smoking policies would be managed by the restaurant owners so that customers would visit the establishment which has the policy they prefer. Customers could decide if they want to avoid smoke-filled rooms or enter them. They might even choose to sit in an area sectioned off for smokers and non-smokers, before the government starts telling restaurant owners what their customers can and cannot do. In my opinion, many smokers do not smell the smoke of others when they are in public places. Many years ago, people were allowed to smoke everywhere. As a result, an entire generation of elderly experienced lung, throat, mouth, and stomach cancers that were never experienced in history before cigarettes became popular. But now, I believe that each individual has the right to make choices which affect only them. So, I choose to visit restaurants that are smoke-free because there are many disadvantages of smoking. A restaurant with smokers is not a healthy environment for people who are having their lunch or dinner. The smokers take away the rights of other people to have access to clean air.
