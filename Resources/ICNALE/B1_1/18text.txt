I agree with the statement. I think there are two reasons why I agree. First, having a part-time job when we are college students can be a preparation for being a member of society. I have had a part-time job for four years. My part-time job is teaching junior high school students Math and English. I have learned many important things. For example, how to talk with my boss, how to deal with personal information and how to associate with my colleagues. If I didn't have it, I would not have any common knowledge, common sense or friends. I think I grew as an adult compared with when I was a high school student. Second, it is a chance for us to know the importance and value of money. When I received a salary for the first time which was made by myself, I thought that I mustn't waste money. Until I entered college, I used to be bought many things by my parents. It is not too much to say that I didn't know how hard we work to make money. Recently, many college students have a part-time job. I think they also learn many things like me. So, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
