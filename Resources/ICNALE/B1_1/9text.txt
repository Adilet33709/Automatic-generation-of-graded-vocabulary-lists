Have you ever had lunch in a restaurant that allows smoking? It is definitely smelly and harmful for all human beings. Then, would it have to be banned in all the restaurants? That is a good question we have to discuss. Some who agree with banning smoking say they will be harmed by the smoke, and it could cause a number of diseases such as heart disease or lung cancer. As we all know, no one wants to get sick. Banning smoking in restaurants can make the air fresher, so more people are more likely to dine there. However, those who disagree with the ban say that it is not fair to them. Some of the restaurants are separated into two areas - a smoking area and non-smoking area. Those who don't want to smoke can go to the non-smoking area and just dine there. Some restaurants even just banned all smoking. Different people can go to their own areas whenever they want. There is no contradiction. To conclude, although there still exists a controversy, we all know that smoking is harmful for all people. Just take it away as soon as possible.
