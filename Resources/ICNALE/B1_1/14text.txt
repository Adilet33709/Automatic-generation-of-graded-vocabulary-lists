Whether it is important to have a part-time job is a hot topic for college students to argue. Different people have different views. Some students advocate the idea for several reasons. One reason is that we college students should be responsible for ourselves, and a part-time job can provide us the opportunity to make money, so that we would not have to ask our parents for allowances. It can also relieve the financial pressure of our parents. Another reason is that through a part-time job, we can gain a lot of experience. Besides, it will be good for us to prepare for our future jobs. As the competition is fiercer in society, the more experience you have, the more chances you will have to succeed. However, other students are against this idea. They hold that as a student, we should focus our attention on studying. Working at a part-time job will require much of our time and energy. The life and property security of a part-time worker are also not well-protected by the law. From my own perspective, as we enter university and gain more free time, it is important for us to choose how to use our free time. We should make the most of it and be the master of it. From my own experience, I am working in a restaurant in my free time, and I am happy to have the job.
