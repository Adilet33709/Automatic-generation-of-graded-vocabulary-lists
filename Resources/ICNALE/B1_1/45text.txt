I think it is best to stop smoking. Smoking is bad for your health. If you continue to smoke, you will eventually die from the effects of smoking. Smoking always causes lung disease, even cancer. Therefore, you should not start smoking. I try my best to avoid any smoking activity around me because I hate the smell of smoke. I try to convince all smokers to stop smoking. However, many people argue that they can just decide to smoke fewer cigarettes. They feel that they can control themselves in not smoking more. I don't think so. You can easily see that it is difficult for smokers to smoke fewer cigarettes. Stopping smoking can protect the health of you and your family members who may breathe your smoke. You should know that your family members are more susceptible to lung disease when you smoke. In my opinion, all smokers should stop smoking to protect their family members and friends. Smokers can use nicotine replacement products to help them stop smoking. There are several kinds of nicotine replacement products. They are small and convenient. Therefore, all smokers should use the nicotine replacements to start a healthy life and protect their loved ones.
