I agree with the statement because many people in Indonesia smoke, even though in reality, smoking is bad for the human body. I think smoking should be banned at all restaurants in Indonesia because restaurants are places for eating and it isn't delicious if other people are smoking in the same area. Passive smoking is very dangerous because it can cause cancer, so I agree with the above statement. However, the government must be careful with restaurants and smoking areas because people in Indonesia could become sick. And the price of cigarettes must be increased because it could reduce the number of smokers in Indonesia. Smoking does not have many positives for people and the country. A country without smokers can be a beautiful country because there is no pollution and the people can be healthy. I want Indonesia to be free from pollution because in Indonesia there is a lot of pollution, for example, from motorcycles, cars, and cigarette smoke. However, smoking should be not banned at all restaurants, but in all places that have many children there because children are growing. So, the children must be kept away from smoking areas. I would love a country free of pollution.
