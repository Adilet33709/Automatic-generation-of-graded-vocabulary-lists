According to the Chinese government's announcement, smoking will be completely banned at all of the restaurants in the country on Jan. 1, 2011. People have been discussing heatedly whether this ban should go into effect since the news came out. Of course, for non-smokers, it is really beneficial. However, for smokers, it is too strict and unrealistic. Personally, I approve of it very much. First of all, many customers, who spend much money in going to restaurants, just want to enjoy a nice meal and have a good time there, but with the irritating smoke surrounding them, how can they feel comfortable? What's more, as we all know, smoking does harm to not only the smoker himself, but also the people around him, whom we usually call second-hand smokers. On one hand, burning tobacco smoke contains more than 20 kinds of toxins that are hazardous to life, among which nicotine is the largest killer that can greatly increase the risk of heart disease and lung cancer. On the other hand, scientists find that non-smokers experience psychological harm as well. When they are exposed to the smoke, their levels of depression and anxiety can increase. Finally, let us look at the statistics showing that thousands of fire accidents are due to the littering of non-extinguished cigarette ends, not to mention the related deaths and losses. So, no smoking, no crying! Taking all of the factors into account, I stick to the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all of the restaurants in the country.
