I am studying for a Bachelor’s degree. This is my first year, and my father is a very poor man. He is very hardworking, but I am the oldest of six brothers and sisters, and we all are going to learn studies in different classes, so my parents cannot afford to pay for our schools and colleges. I love my father and my family so much. To lessen the burden of my expenses on my father, which he cannot afford, I work at a primary school part-time because I am fond of reading. My part-time job enables our parents to feel relaxed, because I help to increase our overall income, and I don’t waste my free time. I want to become an independent person. We can fulfil our needs more easily, and I can learn new abilities, discipline, honesty, and caring. While having a part-time job has many advantages, there are also some disadvantages because my work disturbs my study time. I cannot study as much as I should. But I am happy about it. God always help me in my studies, and he always shows me the right way.
