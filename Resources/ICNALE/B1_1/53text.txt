Recently, banning smoking at all restaurants has become a hot topic of discussion. The government has also implemented a law to ban smoking in public areas. Supporters point out that banning smoking in restaurants can improve the air quality of restaurants as well as the health of workers and customers. Other people, such as restaurant owners, argue that this can cause losses in terms of profit. As a whole, the benefits of banning smoking in all restaurants outweighs its drawbacks. First, banning smoking can improve the air quality of restaurants, as it reduces the release of secondhand smoke from smokers, which contain harmful substances such as tar and nicotine which are harmful for non-smokers and workers in restaurants. Customers still inhale secondhand smoke when sitting in non-smoking areas due to the air-conditioner systems of restaurants. Passive smoking can cause even greater harm to the health of non-smokers than active smoking. That explains why smoking should be banned in all restaurants. Some people argue that some smokers may not go to restaurants after banning smoking, and would result in loss of profit. They also add that at some restaurants, such as discos and bars, most customers are smokers. However, banning smoking at restaurants can improve their image and increasing numbers of non-smoking customers compensate for the reduction in the number of smoking customers. Passive smoking in bars and discos still cause harm to their workers.
