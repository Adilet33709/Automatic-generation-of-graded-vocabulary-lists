I agree with the idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Of course, college students have to study but study isn't all they have to do. They also have to experience a lot of things before they graduate from  college and begin to work. For example, reading books, listening to music, playing sports, and going on trips. In regards to trips, they can go where they haven't visited, see what they haven't seen and feel something special. College students are not children but also not adults. Time while being a college student is time to experience and feel a lot of things  as they prepare to become perfect adults. For that, they need some money. They have to prepare the money they need by themselves, because they aren't children. Their parents mustn't give them money and they mustn't depend on help from their parents. To use the money they work to get is important. By using money they work to get, they can know the importance of money and ways to use money. That's why they have to have a part-time job.
