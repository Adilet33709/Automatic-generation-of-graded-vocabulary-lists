These days, the interior of all buildings is marked "non-smoking". Also, the toilet is non-smoking; you must smoke in the smoking room. Everyone knows that cigarettes have bad effects on the body, and I hate cigarette smoke. Thus, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First, cigarettes contain bad things such as naphthalene and many other chemicals. Thus, I am sure that they are harmful things for both smokers and non-smokers. But, cigarette has the worst effect on non-smokers. You should not do damage to other people. Therefore, you should act responsibly. Second, isolate smoking rooms are available in all buildings. Smoking rooms only allow smoking within the room. For example, all coffee shops, restaurants or PC rooms have smoking rooms attached. So, it is right that you should smoke in the smoking room. Finally, cigarettes contain burning material. Lit cigarettes can burn down buildings. Actually, sometimes I have seen news content in which cigarette butts caused forest fires. I think that smoking deserves to be banned at all restaurants and bus stations. Therefore, I agree that smoking should be banned at buildings or restaurants.
