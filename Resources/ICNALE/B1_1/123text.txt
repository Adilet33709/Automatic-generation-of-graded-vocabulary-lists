Having a part-time job as a college student is important because it serves as training for us, even though we need to balance study and work. I think that being college students, if we want to buy something we really want, we should earn money for ourselves rather than using our parents’ money. By using our own money, we will not feel guilty anymore. If we have a part-time job, we will gain work experience and have the chance to adapt to the different relationships between classmates and colleagues earlier than the people who do not have part-time jobs. Work experience can help us, as college students, to find the ideal job more easily in the future. Moreover, we can also learn how to deal with the problems that may occur in our future working lives. As college students, we can also expand our interpersonal relationships by having a part-time job. In recent years, interpersonal relationships have become the most important factor in our work environment. If we have a good relationship with our colleagues and friends, when we have problems or want other people to help us, they will try their best to help us. I read an article which said that without friends, we cannot do anything perfectly. I have the same belief that interpersonal relationships are very important in our daily lives. Many people will think that having a part-time job may affect our studies, but I really think that having a part-time job as college students can help us in the future to become much better, whether in relation to our attitude toward money, in gaining work experience, or in our interpersonal relationships.
