I strongly agree with the issue because I cannot endure people smoking. Sometimes I can understand why people smoke, so I don't blame them. But when I want to take a break, the smell makes me distracted. It is really not a good experience. Actually, smoking is not a good habit since it is not good for your health. More importantly, it affects not only you but also the people around you. It can hurt your breathing system and even result in lung cancer. Your teeth may be yellower and you can't give up this habit unless you make up your mind. You want one every time you finish your dinner, lunch, even breakfast. You especially like the feeling of smoking with your "good friends". You even like to go on smoking when your parents or wife (husband) do not want you to. Giving up smoking is a very long journey not only for you but also for your family. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. At least, restaurants should mark an area as "no smoking" for a clean eating condition. Smokers should be aware that not everybody likes the smell.
