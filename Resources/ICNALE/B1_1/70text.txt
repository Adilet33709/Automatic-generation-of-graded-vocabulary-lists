It is well known that people going to a restaurant or bar have the right to look forward to a good time and pleasant meal. Unfortunately, these expectations are often spoiled by the odour of smoke. More and more countries have decided to ban smoking in all public places, including restaurants and coffee shops. Despite all of the evidence that smoking causes lung cancer and other severe conditions, there are still many citizens who smoke in our society. Should the government prohibit all of these people from smoking in public places? In my opinion, they certainly should. First and foremost, as we know, smoking in crowded places is harmful not only to the smoker but also to all of the people standing around that person who breathe in their contaminated smoke. When one individual decides to light up a cigarette, everyone around them has to breathe in nicotine from the air. Secondly, it is very uncomfortable for non-smoking people to go to a bar or restaurant where cigarette smoke wafts. For instance, when a family with children wants to eat out, they usually look for a place for non-smokers to ensure that the children do not have contact with unhealthy smoke. Finally, if smoking is banned, there would be fewer smokers on our streets. Thus, if this prohibition is imposed, perceptions of people would certainly change. To sum up, banning smoking from public places will only have advantages.
