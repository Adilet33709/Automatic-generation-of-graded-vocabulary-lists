I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Here are some reasons. First, college students have much more free time than junior high school students and working people. So, college students have to use some time for working. If they have a lot of time, they often use the time for only leisure. If they use it for a part-time job, they may get something good for their life. This is the second reason. College students can learn a lot of things that they can't learn in their college. They can learn, for example, the difficulty of making money, systems in society, and they can also learn gratitude to their parents. Third, I think that college students should be independent of their parents, because college students aren't children; they are almost adults. It is difficult for them to be completely independent from their parents, but it is important to become independent in some ways. One of the points I think is having a part-time job. They should make money that they use for leisure. Even if the money they can earn is only a little, the action can help their parents, I think. Those are the reasons why I think that college students should have a part-time job.
