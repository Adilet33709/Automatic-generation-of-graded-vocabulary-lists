I have two opinions of this topic, and this opinion is divided into two viewpoints, that is, an economic point of view and social point of view. First, college tuition is more expensive nowadays than it was in the past. The cost is a burden to many ordinary people -both students and their parents. For this reason, students should work to make money for their college tuition. If students make money for tuition, it will reduce the financial burden for college tuition. Alternatively, students need to make their own pocket money, because college students are adults. Now, they need to embrace their time of economic independence and no longer get money from their parents. Second, to have a part-time job is to gain indirect experience of social life before we join adult society. For this experience, we learned that earning money is very hard, as I have experienced before. We will also experience human relationships of social life. In this society, lots of diverse people are represented in our society. Through this we can learn how to handle these people. Through meeting diverse people, we can learn development of relationships in broader society. To conclude, to have a part-time job gives students many experiences before they join adult society.
