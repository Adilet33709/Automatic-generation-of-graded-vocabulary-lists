The great dilemma of our age is that the numbers of smokers are increasing in our country. The person who is addicted to smoking cannot quit his habit. When he finds a place to smoke, he starts smoking. He is totally ignorant about the dangers of smoking for him and his fellow beings. A dangerous aspect of smoking is the use of smoking in hotels and near the food place. The smoke of the cigarette spoils the food items and when we eat, it causes many diseases. Smoking is not only harmful for the smoker but also for the citizens of the country. Smokers spread the dirty and poisonous smoke all around them. Vegetables, fruit and other food items have a natural capacity to absorb the dangerous gasses, which smokers spread in the atmosphere. It is our moral duty to keep our hotels, restaurants and other food shops safe from these smokers. It is the government’s responsibility to ban smoking and the use of tobacco in the country, especially in hotels and food places. By acting upon these principles, we can reduce the chance of many great diseases because it is the big cause of pollution, especially in food production.
