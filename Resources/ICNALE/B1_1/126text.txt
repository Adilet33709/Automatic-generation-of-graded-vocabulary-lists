Part-time jobs are those small jobs which students at college level do alongside their studies. The students are bound to do these jobs because their parents are poor so they cannot afford to pay their children’s tuition fees. The student does jobs in various small places. However, their health is affected by doing part-time jobs. They cannot study seriously, and their results go down. Over time, as the burden of work increases, they become sick due to too much work. They cannot take leave for even one day in college so they miss classes and their salary drops, but they cannot rest; they have to go to college in the morning and job in the evening and after that they have to study. Students who only need to study have better results than the students with jobs. The government does nothing for these students and no NGO or any other institution is working on this project. The government should collect funds for these students who are facing many problems in society. The youth is in danger. If they cannot study seriously, they will not get good jobs in the future and participate in the development of their country. Pakistan, a country which is underdeveloped, is facing many problems, and students are facing these types of problems due to poverty. We should do something for it.
