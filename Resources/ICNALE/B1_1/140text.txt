I don't support smoking in restaurants. The biggest reason is that it is harmful for our health. It causes a lot of diseases such as lung, throat, and mouth cancers, premature births, sterility and early menopause, and it makes one look older. Scientific studies show that addicted smokers' skin will be grey in color, thick, and wrinkled. In addition, the smokers can also harm the health of the other non-smokers with their cigarette smoke. Although a person likes smoking, other people do not want to breathe their smoke and get second-hand smoke diseases. In restaurants, people are eating something. During a meal, it is easy to breathe in second-hand smoke. In this case, second-hand smoke will be more than normal situation. Therefore, nowadays many countries have tried to make a law that smoking in restaurants is illegal. By prohibiting smoking in restaurants, we may be saving the lives of hundreds of people, including your own as well as your family's. If a survey was taken asking people how often they deliberately put the lives of their friends and family at risk, it's a pretty safe bet that most people would say never. However, they may be forced to reconsider their answer with regard to smoking.
