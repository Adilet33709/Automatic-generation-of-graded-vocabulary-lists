I agree with this opinion for two reasons. First, it is painful for people who don't smoke to have dinner in the restaurant. They often have a worse experience when people are smoking. Some people say, “We don't have to ban smoking in the restaurants. It is enough to make the non-smoking seats.” It may be better than if there were no non-smoking seats, but we can't say it is enough. Because smoke really can go everywhere in the restaurants, people who don't smoke are still exposed to smoke. The managers in restaurants should be more careful for their guests to enjoy having their dinner. Second, smoking makes restaurants dirty. I have a part-time job in a Japanese restaurant and guests can smoke everywhere in the restaurant. After the guests go back home, I clean up the room. Then, I always find that there is a lot of ash on the tatami. It is really hard to clean. I also find the color of walls is getting a little yellow. I can't believe there are people who don't hesitate to make the room dirty. They are guests, but it is natural that they should have good manners.
