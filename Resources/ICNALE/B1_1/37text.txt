Cigarettes made from tobacco are made almost everywhere in the world and all countries and almost every government around the world allows factories to produce cigarettes for sale to people. A lot of profits are earned by both governments and enterprises each year. However, WHO knows the danger of cigarettes for the health of smokers and non-smokers are equal or even worse for non-smokers. Smoking can cause cancer and many other symptoms. Smoking in public places such as public parks, bus stops, or in the street, which are open areas, cause danger to the health of people, not only smokers but also non-smokers who are in the area. If smokers smoke in a closed area such as in a theater, house, restaurant, airplane, etc., it can cause more danger because everyone, both smokers and non-smokers, will easily be harmed by the smoke. Restaurants are places where people come to enjoy their food and drinks, mostly with their families, and if smokers come to sit together in the same restaurants and start to smoke, it can ruin the atmosphere in the restaurants and also cause danger to the health of all people around them. The air-conditioned restaurants are even worse when smokers start smoking their cigarettes because there is no air ventilation to get rid of all the smoke and it will be in the breath and lungs of all people. The government, especially the ministry of public health, which takes care of the health of people, should issue a law against smoking in both non air-conditioned and air-conditioned restaurants to keep people away from cigarette smoke. I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country.
