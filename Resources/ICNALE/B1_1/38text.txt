I think we should ban smoking in public places completely because cigarettes are harmful to the body. The reason is that the diseases related to the smoking can be prevented and fire hazards can be reduced. Above all, making a rule that restricts smoking in public areas plays an important role in preventing smoking-related diseases. This is because there are all kinds of carcinogens in cigarette smoke. The smoke is full of harmful components that can cause cancer, asthma, or other fatal diseases that can affect not only the smokers themselves but also non-smokers around them. Thus, by banning smoking in public places, we can reduce the risk of getting smoke-related diseases. Moreover, preventing smoking in public areas can contribute to decreasing fire danger. Cigarette butts that are thrown away without being fully extinguished can cause irreversible disasters like mountain fires. I have to consider everyone in the world for their families and their health. Also, a strong anti-smoking law should be introduced.
