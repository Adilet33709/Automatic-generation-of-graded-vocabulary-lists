Restaurants are public places for people. Many people go to these places, like children and the elderly. Eating can be good if we know how to choose everything for ourselves. There are many factors, such as atmosphere, cleanliness, flavor, procedure, price, place, etc. Eating can also be bad. There are many factors for this, too, like smoking. It is an important cause of many bad things. This is what I think about smoking in restaurants. Smoking is bad for your health and other people's health, like by causing bad breath, bad teeth, inhalation of pollutants, and bad looks. Addition, it is a cause of bad atmosphere and makes the area dirty. Eating becomes bad too. Therefore, we should ban smoking in restaurants because it has many bad results for health, atmosphere, and eating. This is not something far from us. It concerns our lives and those very close to us. You may think that you cannot do this but actually, you can. You start by keeping yourself from smoking in public places and restaurants, and then you tell the members of your family not to hurt people by smoking and making bad smells around those places, then tell or warn your friends or any others to not smoke in any place that can hurt others. This way, smoking can be stopped or reduced. See that it's easy to do if you start yourself and expand to others around you.
