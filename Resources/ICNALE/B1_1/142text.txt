I don't agree that college students should have a part-time job for several reasons. The first reason is that it can break the focus of students' studying. The second reason is that it is so difficult to balance studying and working. Consequently, one of them will become a victim. Because when students have problem, it will affect the other one. If the reason of students working is to get experience, surely there must be consideration before that because working and learning are difficult to put together. As a college student, I don't agree that college students should have a part-time job. Especially if the students cannot manage their time well, because it only break the focus of their studying. Moreover, it is difficult to balance studying and working. Consequently, one of their choices will become a victim. So, the students cannot study as well as usual. When they have a problem, of course it will affect the other one. Even though they work to get experience, surely there must be consideration before that because working and learning are difficult to put together.
