I was lucky enough that my parents paid for my whole college education. But I agree with that statement because by having a part-time job, we can help our parents, and we can earn money to buy everything we want. Besides, by doing a part-time job, we can get many experiences that may be useful in the future because experience is most important for getting a job. Moreover, we will appreciate the money more because we know how difficult it is to get money. However, we must manage our time for studying and doing the part-time job, so we have to have care about our time. Everybody knows that time is money. Managing our time is important if we do not want to lose something. So, having a part-time job is important for college students because we can get many advantages from it. If we believe we can do it, then why not? But, we have to remember that studying is our priority; therefore, even though we have a part-time job, we cannot be lazy about studying because we can get experience, and we can get used to living in society besides as a student. We have to be smart to manage our time so we can take advantage of it. Talk more, do more, and get more.
