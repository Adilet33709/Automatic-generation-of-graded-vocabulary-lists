Some people think that ban on smoking at all restaurants is bad. But I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are some reasons why I think so: other people's health, bad smell and clear environment of restaurants. First of all, other people's health is very important. If people smoke at restaurants, other people's health can be bad. Especially, if there are pregnant women, the elderly and babies present, it can be very harmful to them. Second, people get angry if they smell bad smoke. Cigarettes smell very bad and it can make people feel unpleasant. The people have a right to enjoy good smells at a restaurant. Third, if heavy smokers smoke at restaurants, the restaurants' environment can become dirty. The tobacco smoke can go into the food and the remains of cigarettes can go into the food. Also, the restaurants' furniture will be dirty because of cigarettes. So, because of these three reasons, I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
