Some people who smoke are very rude. They smoke not only on the street, also in restaurants. When they smoke in restaurants, other people who don't smoke feel upset. Smoking creates fumes and dirty dust. People who smoke smell of cigarettes. That creates discomfort. I think people who smoke in restaurants are selfish. They enjoy smoking and do not care about other people who don't smoke. What I am talking about is that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Some restaurants have smoking seats, but there are non-smoking seats nearby. Fumes and dust move to every table in the restaurant. Guests in the restaurant might be angry if someone sitting at the next table is smoking. Then, there would be gossip about the restaurant's cleanliness and etiquette. It is a good choice for owners to forbid smoking in their restaurants. Restaurants are where people eat dinner. Maybe it is special dinner for someone. Smoking can break into that special mood. Apparently, smoking in restaurants is a very serious problem. I wish that smoking were banned in restaurants as soon as possible. I want to eat dinner in a restaurant where no one is smoking.
