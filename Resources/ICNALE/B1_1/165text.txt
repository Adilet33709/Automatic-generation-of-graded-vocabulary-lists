I strongly agree with the idea that it is important for university students to have a part-time job for two reasons. First, students can acquire knowledge. Second, a part-time job is a good start for a students’ career preparations. By doing a part-time job, university students acquire life skills that will never be gained in class. In class, what students have learnt so far is entirely theoretical knowledge or concepts, such as mathematical equations in Physics or grammar usage in English writing. University students gain enough academic knowledge; however, they know little about the life skills which are extremely important for them to make a living. By having a part-time job, students have the chance to be exposed to practical society and from this experience they will gain life skills. For example, being a coordinator of public relations, a student will learn the art of communicating with different kinds of people properly. Thus, having a part-time job is beneficial for career preparation. In the short term, students have an invaluable opportunity to put their book knowledge to practical use. The knowledge gained in class is taught to be used by the students for their future careers. There is an old saying that says, “practice makes perfect.” Applying knowledge to practice, students will have a deeper understanding of what they learn. In the long term, the experience of doing a part-time job is helpful evidence of a student's capability for future job applications. As demonstrated above, acquisition of life skills and knowledge are guaranteed by having a part-time job. Students who have work experience are more likely to get hired because companies are more willing to hire those who are more experienced. Due to the two reasons described above, the significance of having a part-time job for a university student is quite clear.
