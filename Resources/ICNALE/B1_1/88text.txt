I think it depends on the situation. As a student, it's hard for me to have a part-time job because I cannot concentrate on my studies. When you have a part-time job you should know how to balance your time and have good time management. A part-time job is important because you have benefits like you can help your family, and if you have a project you can buy resources without regrets or concerns about where you can get the money. You can also gain new experiences and knowledge by working, and find opportunities for a range of careers. Moreover, you can transform what you've learned in class into practice, and learn how to cooperate with others and deal with different challenges. The best thing that a part-time job does is enable you to help your family in terms of money. Yet, a bad thing about having a part-time job is that you don't have much time to go out with your loved ones. A part-time job is good if you have good time management and can manage it well, but if you can't, it is important to try to manage your time properly to be able to have a part-time job.
