Smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants in the country so that it will lessen the number of places that people can smoke in. This is because smoking is a bad habit that is widespread among teenagers. Cigarettes contain dangerous items which destroy the human brain and lungs. Smoking causes different diseases, such as cancer, in different areas of the human body. Based on what I have heard, the reason teenagers smoke is that they believe that through smoking they can show people that they are adults and can do whatever they want. Smoking is very bad for your health and causes a lot of pollution in the environment. Even if you don’t smoke, you can also get some of the same diseases that smokers get by simply smelling cigarette smoke. There are a lot of disadvantages when you're smoking, including that it wastes your money and causes diseases like lung cancer and other health problems, and if you are smoking it will also lead to addiction. Smoking is very bad in that it can lead death if you do not stop. I hope that our government will pass a law that people who smoke will be imprisoned, even just for a month, so that they will be afraid to smoke. Smoking should be completely banned in all places here in the Philippines.
