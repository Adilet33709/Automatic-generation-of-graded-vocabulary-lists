In the science museum, there is an exhibition of two lungs, one is a lung of a smoker, and the other is a healthy lung. You can see a lot difference between the two lungs; the smokers lung is black and broken. This tells us that smoking is not a good thing. Smokers make a choice to smoke, and other people have the power to say NO. I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Every time we choose a restaurant to have a date, we go on the Internet to search for information, call the restaurant to make a booking, and finally it's time to go to the restaurant. You are eating and chatting for a while and then a person sits next to your table and starts smoking. What should you do? People like to do whatever they want, but sometimes these things harm you and others. For the health of your friends and other people, if you want to smoke you should go outside of the restaurant. Smoking should be banned because some smokers only think about themselves. There should be laws to tell them not to do so. For good health, the best way is not to touch cigarettes.
