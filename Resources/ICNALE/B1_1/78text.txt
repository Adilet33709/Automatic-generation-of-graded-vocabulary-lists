Thailand is my country and smoking is a big problem. There are a lot of people who have died because they smoke too much and some have died because they breathe among people who often smoke without caring about others. Places that have a lot of people and different habits are restaurants. I have entered a restaurant and next to me there was a man smoking and the smoke was around that area and I was so suffocated because I don't like that smell. Therefore, I very much agree that the restaurants in my country should ban smoking. Moreover, it is very good if restaurants don't have people who would like to smoke and can smoke because it saves a good atmosphere and pure air for others. Banning smoking in restaurants is not enough to reduce the smoking problem, because if someone is addicted to smoking, they still have a lot of places to do it. However, banning smoking in restaurants is a little part that we can do to help the person who wants to smoke for a short time. It is still very good if we ban smoking everywhere to make our country be a country without smoking.
