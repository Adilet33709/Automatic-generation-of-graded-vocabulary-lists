As a college student, I agree to the statement. It is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have 3 reasons to support this opinion. Firstly, for students to learn how to manage money. College students don't have much money, but have lots of time so they tend to use it too much. They're not good at controlling it. If they work, they'll recognize the importance and value of money. They're also going to get responsibility for money so they will never waste it. In the near future we college students will have our own family. We will have to manage money all on our own. We should be independent and learn how to control money as soon as possible. Secondly, for students to know society. Now, in university, lots of students are so lazy. Some are always late for school, some often sleep during class and so on. Thanks to having a part-time job, they can know the responsibility for their tasks. There are many differences between college and society. In society, rules are much stricter than college. If they don't know their society at all, they may not be able to be hired because of bad manners. So for students, a part-time job is a  good opportunity to practice for the future. Lastly, for companies to save money. Now in Japan, the economic situation is not good and companies hire fewer people than usual. So they are in trouble because of lack of staff. If companies hire general people, they have to pay a lot of money. But for students, the pay is only about 800 yen per hour. Companies may want to hire students more than general people. In conclusion, I think college students should get a part-time job both for students and for companies.
