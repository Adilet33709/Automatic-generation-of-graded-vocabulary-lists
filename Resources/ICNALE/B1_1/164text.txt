On the whole, I don't think smoking should be banned through the legal system. It should be a choice of the restaurant owner. Then I would foresee that most restaurants would become non-smoking, or at least a few would still keep ashtrays on the tables. However, what if I am a restaurant owner, especially when I am a school restaurant manager? You know, all the restaurants in Wuhan University do not give permission for people to smoke, but I still see people smoking. I would be strict about banning smoking. Now I will give you my reasons. A person like me who does not smoke also have the right not to smoke, I mean, second-hand smoke. Second-hand smoke causes many of the same diseases as direct smoking, including lung cancer and respiratory diseases. The famous website Wikipedia lists several million words about the bad effects of passive smoking. According to some experts, the effects of passive smoking are even worse than those of first-hand smoking. What's worse, the smoke causes horrible effects on pregnant women and little babies. Thus, considering our country's future, I am strongly against smoking. Restaurants are places for eating, for satisfying your appetite, so at least in some degree eating can substitute the desire for smoking. It might be easier to forget smoking, especially for smoking addicts. Thus, smoking should be banned in restaurants, especially in school restaurants.
