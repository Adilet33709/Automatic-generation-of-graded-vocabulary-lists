I disagree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I don't think that all Japan’s restaurants should have to ban smoking. I often eat lunch or dinner with my friend who is a smoker. On these occasions, we talk for a long time so he sometimes begins smoking. If all restaurants ban smoking, I will be not able to talk and eat dinner with him. Some people may say he shouldn't smoke when he eats dinner, but it is a matter of freedom for him to smoke. It's his own problem whether he smokes or not. Some people dislike smoking, but others do not. What shall they who don't like cigarette smoke do? Almost all restaurants in Japan have non-smoking seats. People who dislike smoking should use these seats. Then, they would not be interrupted by smoke. In Japan, smoking is not banned. If restaurants ban smoking, they will be troubled by fewer customers, because smokers won't dine at the restaurants. For these reasons, I disagree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
