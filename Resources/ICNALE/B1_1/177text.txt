Part-time jobs are activities that one performs outside of his actual job or work. These jobs provide an opportunity for people to earn extra income and improve their lifestyle. As far as students are concerned, part-time jobs could be very useful for them because they not only help them to contribute to their family income but they also physically and mentally prepare them for their future jobs. The first day of a student in college is full of excitement and enthusiasm. Gradually, as time passes, he becomes bored because he has a huge burden of studies on his head and he does not get time to relax and enjoy himself. Part-time jobs can help students to reorganize themselves and to refresh. As it is famous proverb, ‘All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy’. In a part-time job, students meet different people who know more about social behaviour. Then he sometimes gets appreciated for his work, but sometimes he is scolded by his boss. The job provides him with physical activity and mental refreshment. After doing his part-time job, he gets some time to do his college homework. I think that a student can get more appreciation if he secures a part-time position, even he does a job alongside it, compared to a student who secures a position by sitting all day reading his books.
