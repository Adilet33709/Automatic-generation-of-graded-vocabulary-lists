I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. As we know, the cost of college is expensive for students. It's easy if the parents of that student are rich. But, how about for students with poor parents? A part-time job is a solution for this situation. The student can help the parents avoid spending too much money, and the students will have new experiences beside their daily activity of studying. The students must learn how to split their time between studying and having a part-time job. They can also be proud to get their money by themselves instead of asking for money from their parents. In my opinion, they are independent students. If all college students had to do a part-time job, I think parents wouldn't have financial problems. And for those students, it can be a good start for when they work at a company after graduating from that college. We could say that they are training to get a new skill for a job, so it's a positive thing for the student. In this era, if we can, why not? We can learn from college students who have a part-time job. They get money by themselves, so they can help their parents. And I think they make their parents proud by what they are doing.
