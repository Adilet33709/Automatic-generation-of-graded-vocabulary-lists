Smoking is very harmful to human beings, but there are thousands of people smoking around the world, even though they know smoking is harmful. The most serious problem is that non-smokers are damaged by the second-hand smoke of smokers. Media has emphasized the danger of second-hand smoking. Lately, the notion of third-hand smoke has appeared. I have seen TV programs about third-hand smoke. A father usually smokes outside and washes his hands with soap. He hugs his baby and plays with him or her after smoking and washing his hands. Even though the baby doesn't smell the smoke, dangerous things are found on the skin of the baby. The research shows that the baby has the same amount of dangerous remnants as adult smokers. I was shocked by the results of this research. After I saw this program, I realized that we can't escape from the danger of smoking anywhere. Therefore, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Restaurants are public areas where any person can drop by and eat there. In these areas, non-smokers are easily affected by smokers. Smokers have to know the effect of their smoking on others. The government should take action for the health of all citizens.
