In my opinion, I strongly agree with the idea that it is important for our college students to have a part-time job. Now we can see everywhere that students take part-time jobs like private teacher, seller and so on. Why do they do these jobs? What advantages benefit them? I think the main reason is money. With the improvement of our living standards, a lot of study materials are more expensive than before. Then the student has to take up some jobs to reduce considerable financial pressure. By doing so, we can also have the ability to travel or buy some items we like. We also hope that through this way, we can no longer be dependent on our parents. In addition, we can also accumulate some social experience. From kindergarten to high school, what we have learned is totally the knowledge from books. In this way, work experience offers a lot of benefits to our future jobs. In a word, there are many advantages for our college students to have some jobs: we not only make money, but also develop our independence. Thus, if you have a lot of free time after class, try to look for a part-time job and you will not regret it.
