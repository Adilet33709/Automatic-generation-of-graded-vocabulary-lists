I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are two reasons. First, college students can learn a lot of things that they don't study at college through working. For example, relationships, skills and manners. I have a part-time job in a Japanese restaurant. The work is very hard, and I often receive advice from colleagues and from my boss. Sometimes I am scolded very badly. I want to quit the job when the boss scolds me, but my colleagues and boss help me when I'm in trouble. In fact, I really thank them because they teach me important things for fitting in with society. I have also become responsible because of my job. I really realize that I have matured through working. It is good for me. Secondly, college students can communicate with many people with whom they can't speak in daily life. In the Japanese restaurant where I work, there are many housewives. I sometimes feel that there is a generation gap, but talking with them is very fun. We talk about raising children and money. They talk about things that I don't know about. It is very interesting for me. I think having a part-time job gives a lot of important social benefits to college students.
