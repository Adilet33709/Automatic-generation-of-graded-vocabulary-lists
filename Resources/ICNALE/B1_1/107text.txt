Smoking is an addictive activity for some people. It is a bad action and is disgusting looking. Some see smoking as a fashion. Some think smoking looks smart, but I think it ought to disappear in public because it is such a nuisance. I agree with this topic fully because in my opinion, smoking should be banned at all public places and everywhere. First, it may disturb others who would not like smoking and are around that place. Second, it will make the others who are not smoking inhale smoke too. Third, smoking makes an odor whose smell might disperse to others. It may dirty the clothes of others. Smoking can affect the future, pollution, and make our health worse. Smoking can make people moody, unhappy, etc. In restaurants, smoking should not happen because there are people who want no pollution, good food, good service, good greetings, etc. If there is smoking in the restaurant, people in the restaurant must inhale smoke too. It may make people in the restaurant irritated with the smoke because of the odor, coughing, bad surroundings, etc. It surely affects others, so smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
