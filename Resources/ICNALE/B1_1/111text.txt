When we eat in a restaurant, we may see people smoking. If we are not smokers, we will feel uncomfortable, since we will breathe in the smoke. Therefore, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. Smoking harms people's health. Research has shown that smoking not only threatens smokers, but also does harm to people around the smokers. When I go to restaurants with a friend of mine, a heavy smoker, I get a sore throat. He smokes a lot in restaurants, since restaurants haven’t banned smoking. It is unfair for non-smoking people to be affected by smoking when they go to restaurants. There are usually some children in these restaurants. If smoking is not banned, these children will be affected by the smoke from cigarettes, since children are more vulnerable. Restaurants are places for having food, not smoking. It is disgusting for non-smoking customers to smell smoke when they are enjoying their food. Smoking may cause fires in restaurants if the cigarette stubs are thrown on the tablecloth, which threatens customers' lives. Smokers can smoke somewhere outside restaurants, but not in restaurants, because restaurants are not suitable places for smoking. Customers want to have a comfortable and safe place to enjoy their food, and smoking is not suitable in restaurants. Therefore, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants.
