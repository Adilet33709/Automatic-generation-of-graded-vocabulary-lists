A part-time job is one way of earning money to gain extra income. People want to have a part-time job so that they can have a source of income when they need it or have something to buy. It is also a way of socializing with other people, for example through internet-networking jobs, which are not only jobs which enable you to have extra income, they also enable you to become popular with other people. Many students work part-time jobs to supply themselves with additional funds. As a student, I will say that it is important to have a part-time job because at a young age I could help my mom financially and have my own source of income. If there is something I want to buy, I can easily buy it. It also helps me to buy things for school, for projects, assignments, and paying tuition fees. For me, it is also a way of socializing with other people, I meet different people and they become my friends. Last, it is important because it can train me to be confident, comfortable, and well prepared for the future.
