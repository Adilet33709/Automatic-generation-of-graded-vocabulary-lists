Recently, some people have argued that the current education system cannot equip students with practical skills for working and just emphasizes the importance of academic performance. They suggest that university students have a part-time job and this can improve their  problem-solving abilities. However, others may argue that taking a part-time job may affect the academic performance of students. I think that the benefit of taking a part-time job outweighs its drawbacks. Firstly, taking a part-time job can give students with the chance to learn more about teamwork, as they may need to finish a proposal with other people. Most jobs, such as the job of sales manager, involve team work and everyone needs to operate with each other well no matter what position in the company. Also, their communication skills may improve, as they need to talk with strangers. Taking a part-time job is helpful for students’ personal development. First, they can learn about their interests, weaknesses, or strengths if they try different part-time jobs. This can build up student's confidence as well as develop their own potential. Some people may argue that taking a part-time job affects the academic performance of students. They even point out that some students may lose concentration during lessons and may be absent from some lessons. In fact, such problems cannot exist if students can allocate time well. This also gives students the chance to learn how to manage time well.
