It is a well-known fact that millions of people die every year from lung cancer as a result of smoking. Thus, many countries prohibit smoking in public places. However, some people think it disturbs their individual freedom and choices. To my mind, smoking in public places, especially in restaurants and cafes, must be banned. Restaurants are for eating, not smoking. People who do not smoke suffer from the fumes and smell. Scientists are sure that passive smoking is equally harmful to our health. Smoking affects our health; for example, when a pregnant woman smokes, she should understand that her unborn baby in the womb is smoking also, and his or her life could be at risk. Every year more and more babies are born ill or even dead because of their mother’s bad habit. Undoubtedly, there are many children and young people in different cafes and public places, and they should not have to see adults smoking because they will learn bad habits from them. On the other hand, we live in a democratic world, and everyone has the right to do want s/he wants; this is freedom. In fact, everyone must respect other people's feelings and we must cooperate with each other. In conclusion, I want to say that banning smoking is a necessary measure for the health of the nation. In my opinion, we must prohibit the advertisement of tobacco in mass media, and parents should explain the damage that tobacco can cause to their children. We are all responsible for future generations. Countries that have already forbidden smoking in public places had taken a big step forward compared to the countries that have not done it yet.
