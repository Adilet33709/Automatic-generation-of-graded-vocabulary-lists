I think smoking shouldn't be banned at all restaurants, because different customers have different requirements. We all know smoking is bad for people themselves, and can affect their neighbors' health though second-hand smoke, so most restaurants should ban smoking to protect their customers' health. This also makes our city clean and healthy. But should all restaurants do so? I don't think so, because it's too strict and doesn't respect all people's rights. Some customers just want to go somewhere they can smoke and we assume people who go to the restaurants that allow smoking. Many people have a habit of smoking, and they need cigarettes to calm themselves, especially businessmen when they talk about business over dinner. We know that many successful businessmen like smoking and smoking helps them handle things better. Many people just enjoy smoking and their friends may also like it. The best way for them to have their entertainment may be having lunch with cigarettes, and a restaurant that allows smoking is their best choice for that. It's better for them to smoke in a restaurant than in other public environments. Limiting smoking to a small space is better than spreading it out.
