I agree with the topic of this essay that smoking should be banned at all restaurants. Most of us have experienced when people start smoking in restaurants. Since smoking causes many bad effects in our society, it must be banned in restaurants and similar places. Smoking can affect the health of women and children, and smokers lower the living standards of our society and pollute the environment. Women and children have a weaker immune system than men, and it is scientifically proven that smoking is much more harmful for the people who inhale the second-hand smoke than the smoker. The people who breathe the smoke may get lung cancer, blood cancer, have a heart attack or have some respiratory problems for a long time. Smokers also become weaker and are more susceptible to these diseases. Moreover, the upcoming generation who see adults smoking may imitate them. Some of them think that it is the sign of becoming mature, which makes them start smoking earlier to satisfy the feeling of being an adult. Their health must get worse gradually even though they are the bright future of their nation. Therefore, the efficiency and productivity in many fields decreases, which leads to a poorer society with the lack of high standard products and facilities for a comfortable life. In addition, the medicine and treatment fees for people who fall prey to smoking are so large that it takes a large sum of money from the government that could otherwise have been used for purposes such as supporting education, increasing their export business and decreasing the rate of poverty. In conclusion, I think that smoking should be banned in all restaurants, public places, colleges, offices and even on the roads because it will save more people from having lung cancer and save the environment.
