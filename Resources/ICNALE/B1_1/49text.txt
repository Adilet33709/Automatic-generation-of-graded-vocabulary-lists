There is no complete agreement among the students about whether we should take part-time jobs. Many students hold the opinion that we should have part-time jobs. However, there are also a lot of students with a different view. The people who hold the first view think it is helpful and wise to take part-time jobs. Firstly, they think that they can develop their experience and capacities during working. It is obvious that this can prepare them for jobs in the future. Second, they can acquire money on their own, cultivating their independence and skills. Finally, they can meet and interact with a lot of people and learn from them what cannot be taught in school. In contrast, the people who take the second view think that it's not suitable for students to have part-time jobs. Students' primary task is to study, without being distracted from the knowledge that they should gain in school. If they are distracted, they may lose the opportunity of finding a better job after graduation. Thus, it is not right for them to spend their energy and time on a part-time job. Weighing the two kinds of views, I think it is beneficial for us to try to have a part-time job without putting all our time and energy into it.
