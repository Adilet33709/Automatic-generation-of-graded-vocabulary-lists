I agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Because restaurants are places where we enjoy special food and conversation with friends, family, or a boyfriend or girlfriend, smoking is not needed there. Smoking in restaurants has two bad effects. One is that smell of smoking is bad for our enjoyment of food. For example, we can't enjoy the smell of foods if there are people who are smoking in the restaurant. Smell is an important part of food. We enjoy foods by not only their taste but also their smell. Smell can make foods good, or otherwise it can make foods bad. The other bad effect is that smoke is bad for one’s health. In restaurants, there are a lot of people: babies, children, teens, adults, and the elderly. Smoking has a bad influence on them all. Smoking is bad for health of all people, especially for babies and pregnant women. Smokers don't have the right to cause health problems for others. Smoking has these two bad effects. That's why I agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. People who smoke should consider the enjoyment of the food from that restaurant and health of the people around them.
