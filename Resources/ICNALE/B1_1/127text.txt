First of all, smoking is bad for your health. It causes many problems like chest infection, TB and other dangerous diseases. But despite knowing all the effects of smoking on health, many people smoke. These days, people come to restaurants to eat special food. But some people smoke everywhere, even in restaurants. Smoking causes many problems. In restaurants, smoking pollutes the food and causes stomach infections. In foreign countries, some middle- and high-level restaurants have banned smoking. Smoking contains nicotine, which makes the food dirty. A person who smokes not only decreases their lifetime but also impacts other people. If someone asks why you smoke, smokers often reply that they smoke to release tension but they know it is not good for their health, especially in restaurants because it poisons the food. Now it's our duty to save our country from the pollution and effects of smoking. Smoking should also be banned in pubs, where people also come to enjoy eating and drinking. Nicotine is a drug and its effect on the human body is very harmful and causes death. So, please stop smoking and tell people about the harmful effects. It should be banned in restaurants and a no smoking sign should be stuck on the wall of all restaurants.
