Ｉdon't think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Nowadays, almost all restaurants in Japan have two different seats. One is a seat for non-smokers, the other is a seat for smokers. When you go to a restaurant, a waiter surely asks you whether you smoke or not. So if you don't smoke or you hate cigarette smoke, you should choose a seat for non-smokers. However, in the case that you don't smoke but your husband or your friends smoke, they may choose a seat for smokers and you may put up with their smoke. In that case, you should not put up with it. You must say that you want to take a non-smoking seat. If smoking is completely banned at all restaurants, people who like smoking will not be willing to go to restaurant. Because of this, we should not completely ban smoking, but every restaurant should be careful about their internal environment. For example, they should place plants that keep the air fresh, or clean the air sometimes, etc. It is important for restaurants to keep their environment clean. And it is important for people who go to restaurants to say whether they want to smoke or not. For these reasons, I don't think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
