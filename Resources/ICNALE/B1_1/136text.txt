I agree with this opinion because smoking in restaurants can interfere with other people who are eating and make them lose their appetite because of the cigarette smoke, which interferes in the process of eating. Besides that, cigarette smoke also makes others breathe in secondhand smoke which contains chemicals that can damage human health. Secondhand smoke is more dangerous than cigarette smoke breathed in by active smokers. The concentration of nicotine for passive smokers is greater because the poison is sucked through the cigarette smoke of active smokers, which is not filtered. So that makes the passive smokers die of chemical substances that exist in cigarette smoke, which have been inhaled by humans and cannot be processed in the body. Cigarette smoke can cause heart disease, stroke, and so forth. Therefore, we recommend that active smokers reduce their smoking because cigarettes are very harmful for passive smokers who get affected by the cigarette. Smokers should become aware of how their actions harm others. It is better to fine every person who smokes in restaurants because it can interfere with every visitor who was eating at that place.
