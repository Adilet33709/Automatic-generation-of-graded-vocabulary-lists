Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Are you one of the people that smokes at restaurants? Nowadays, there a lot of people complaining that they want to ban smoking at restaurants, what do you think about it? In my opinion, there are two major reasons for banning smoking completely at all the restaurants in the country. They are that it disturbs others and increases the risk of accidents. First, smoking at restaurants disturbs others such as children, women, and pregnant women. Other people at the restaurant will be disturbed by the smell and smoke from smoking. Smoke from cigarettes contains substances that are harmful to the human body, so smoking at restaurants is disturbing to others and also harmful to their bodies. Second, smoking at restaurants increases the risk of accidents. Smoking cannot occur without fire, and the chefs at restaurants cannot cook food without gas, so if the smokers lack caution, there is a chance for there to be an accident. In conclusion, smoking at restaurants should be banned for two major reasons. It disturbs others and is harmful to the human body. If Thai people cannot stop smoking at restaurants, what kind of society will Thailand become in the future?
