I agree with this statement. These days, many restaurants in Japan are likely to separate the smoking area from the non-smoking area. However, some of them fail to separate them completely. This means that even if I take a table in the non-smoking area, I may smell the cigarettes from the smoking area. Cigarette smoke makes me uncomfortable, especially when I am having a meal. In my opinion, the solution to this problem is that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. Moreover, smoking is bad for our health, and some studies have shown that if people smoke while they are eating, their risk of getting cancer is increased. So, the Japanese government should ban smoking at all restaurants in order to save all citizens' health. From my personal experience, I believe that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in Japan. One of my friends was able to quit smoking by the increasing number of non-smoking areas. It became harder for her to find areas where smoking is allowed. This made her smoking fewer cigarettes per day, and now she doesn't want to smoke at all anymore. Therefore, since I heard this story, I've believed that policy of smoking being banned in all restaurants makes it easier to quit smoking. That's why I believe that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in Japan.
