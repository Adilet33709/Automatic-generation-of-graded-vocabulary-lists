At present, the economy keeps on growing and that makes the cost of living also go up. The costs of studying in universities are rising as well. These costs include semester fees, registration for credits, transportation fees, meals, and so on. Some students who left their houses to study far away or in different provinces have to pay for renting rooms in apartments, which cost more than what the students who come back home every day pay. The burden of this goes on to their parents to earn more money, not only to feed their children but also to send their children to study higher education. A part-time job is one of the options that college students can choose to relieve the burdens of their parents. Thus, college students have to make the decision to choose a part-time job that is appropriate for their studying time because they have to study hard along with working. A part-time job that is related to their studies will be more advantageous for them, but sometimes those kinds of jobs are quite rare. Therefore, many college students do not have many choices to choose for work. Anyway, students have to get part-time jobs to earn money for taking care of themselves and save their parents' money. A part-time job for college students now has become very important for those who want to help their parents and earn experience while they are working. Sometimes the experiences they receive are worth enough for their futures. Although some college students are not in trouble with all the costs, they are eager to work to earn experience and get money to buy things they need.
