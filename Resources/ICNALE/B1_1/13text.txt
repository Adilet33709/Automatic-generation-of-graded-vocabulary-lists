Smoking is a popular activity among human beings, especially men. But as we all know, cigarettes contain some poison. Many countries have banned smoking at public places. It's not enough; smoking should be stopped not only in public places but also in restaurants in the country. Scientists have proven that cigarettes have nicotine. It's a kind of poison. People who smoke for a long time may get nicotine poisoning, and if it's very serious, they will die because of it. Further, people who always smoke can also get lung cancer. It can't be cured. Patients suffer unimaginable pain. Thus, to maintain or improve human beings' health, smoking should be banned completely at all restaurants. Smoking is not only bad for smokers, but also unhealthy for the people around them. When one person is smoking, the people around him may get second-hand smoke. The second-hand smoke also contains nicotine and is also harmful to humans' bodies. We can see that if people smoke in a restaurant, everyone in the restaurant will be harmed by them. As far as I know, smoking also pollutes the environment. The smoke it produces will pollute our atmosphere. So if we can ban smoking, we will save our world. I don't know why people invented smoking, but I know why people should stop smoking. In other words, smoking is bad for our health and also harmful for our world. Banning smoking completely at all restaurants in the country is a little step. One day we will stop smoking all over the world!
