I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country because restaurants are places for visitors to eat and drink. Restaurants are not the correct place to smoke. Some people smoke after they finish eating, but how about other people? Do they like to do it? I think they feel uncomfortable about that situation. If that situation happens, the government must look for solution to this problem. Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. It is the solution for people who don't like smoking. As we know, visitors of all ages, from young to old, go to restaurants. Smokers must know about that, but they make the restaurant dirty. So, restaurants must give a special place for smokers, if they want to smoke. It is a better solution for the smokers and for the visitors who don't like smoking in restaurants. If the smoker fails to obey that regulation, the restaurant can give them a punishment. Maybe that smoker will have to clean the plates and glasses, or clean the restaurant floor. I hope that the solution can make smokers give up so they will not do it again, and they will keep a clean condition at that restaurant. I hope that the solution can be done at all restaurants and in other countries besides Indonesia so that visitors can feel comfortable and not worry about cigarette smoke in restaurants.
