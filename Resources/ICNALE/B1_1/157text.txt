I agree that is important for students to have a part-time job at college. In our country, children are protected by their parents until they are 18 or older. We don't have much time to experience the outside world. Going to college is the first time we have to deal everything ourselves, so I think it's a perfect time to make more friends and know how hard it is for our parents earn money. You can learn a lot of things from a part-time job; for example, if you are a clerk, you can learn how to use the cash register and how to talk to customers. From those experiences, you may know how to interact with other people in a polite way. Also, you can try to release some pressure off your parents by letting them know you can do those things, so they don't have to worry about you. Moreover, in college we have a lot of activities, so you always have to spend some money. If you want to save money, you must try to earn money, and the income must be more than the money you spend. Although it's important to have a part-time job, we must remember our main job is our school work. Learning how to schedule our time is another challenge. Having a part-time job can make students more independent and more responsible for their lives.
