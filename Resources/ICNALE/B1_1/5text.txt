Nowadays, there still exist many uncivilized behaviors in public such as smoking, spitting, and littering. I believe that smoking recklessly in public especially does harm both to the health of the people and the environment. As such, I support the initiative that smoking should be completely banned in public. The following reasons support my argument. Undoubtedly, the banning of public smoking is not only beneficial to others but also to the smoker's health. If smoking is banned, smokers may smoke less, there will be less second-hand smoke released into the air, and people will have fewer chances of being exposed to the polluted air. Furthermore, a non-smoking environment will bring us fresh air and good moods. This will obviously promote cultural and ideological progress by forbidding bad manners and developing good ones. In addition, it is a reminder that we should improve our awareness of caring for others. Since it is not only beneficial to the smokers themselves but also to society, why not do it? All of the aforementioned reasons tell us the advantages of the banning. It is time to take the advice of banning and to put special emphasis on the improvement of our public environment, though it is a little harsh to the smokers.
