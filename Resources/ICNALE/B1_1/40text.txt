We know the behavior of smoking is very awful; it not only harms your lungs but is also dangerous for everybody around you. Because the drug harms the human body, smoking has to be banned everywhere, except when you are alone. Someone who is smoking will influence other people, when they are in public places. If a person is smoking next to you while you are enjoying delicious food, you will smell the smoke and feel uncomfortable. Even if the dish tastes good, you will just want to get away from the smoker and won't be able to enjoy your dish. Smoking in restaurants makes everyone unhappy and harms their lungs and yours. The smell easily gets on clothes, so people who are not smokers will be influenced by the bad smell, making others think they are smokers and thus giving a bad image. Not only does smoking harm your health but it also makes other people lose their human rights. If you do not care about your health, no one can stop you smoking, but other people have the right to say "no" to your behavior. In order to improve everyone's moods, health, and their human rights, smokers should be banned from smoking at restaurants and all public places.
