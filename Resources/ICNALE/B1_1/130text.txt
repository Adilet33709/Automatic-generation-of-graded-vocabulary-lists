In front of each building, so many people smoke cigarettes. Some people say that when they smoke cigarettes they feel free and can rest easily between work times. However, I think it's not a suitable way to behave. No matter how they feel, it's a really harmful way to act for everybody, including non-smokers. So, I want to insist that we should prohibit smoking cigarettes for several reasons. First, if someone smoke cigarettes next to others, the bystanders couldn't avoid the potential dangers. We always advise smokers that their children and family could face a potentially harmful situation; their family could have lung cancer, and could get some respiratory disease. For their own family, smokers always think of smoking cigarettes. Second, when someone smokes cigarettes, they can't easily stop smoking because of their addiction. According to several pieces of research, when smokers stop smoking, their hands may shake or they may gain weight suddenly. If they continue to smoke cigarettes, they would be more likely to get mental and physical disease compared to non-smokers. I totally agree that the government should make cigarette prices higher. If it spontaneously makes smokers decrease their intake, the cigarette market will have to get more tax and fix product prices higher.
