I don't agree that it's important for college students to have a part time job, unless they must. Taiwan's education is not similar to the U.S.; we don't have many choices from which to choose to experience in school. Only in college can we choose many ways to learn, even if your major is not in the department, you can choose the class of other departments. In college, you can study many things, and you can control what time you want to go to school, except for major classes. How many classes you have experienced? Except for major classes, you have much time to do what you want to do, you might want to rest instead of being in class all day or you can use the time to swim or do some sports. How long do you stay in college? General students have 4 years in college in Taiwan; you spend one third of that time going to major classes and more than one third going to other classes, there is not much time left to do things you want to do in depth. Sometimes, you think money is most important for your life, but, in my opinion, learning is really the most important.
