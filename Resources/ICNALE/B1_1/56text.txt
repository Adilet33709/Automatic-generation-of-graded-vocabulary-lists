I think it is important for some students to have a part-time job, but not all students need a part-time job. It's true that part-time jobs can let us practice our abilities, but it also takes a lot of time. Does a part-time job provide benefit to University students? It depends on how much you learn and how much you are paid. For business school students, it's very important to have a part-time job because they really need internships to gain practical experience. When business school students graduate, they will not sit in labs or classrooms. Business school students aim to earn money and they need real experience, not only the knowledge in textbooks. Besides studying, they have lots of spare time and the best way to use the time is to do a part-time job, rather than play computer games all day. But for science students, it may not be so important to have a part-time job. Science school students spend most of their time in labs or libraries. The most important thing for them is to gain lab skills and knowledge from core courses, so they don't have to pay much attention to having a part-time job.
