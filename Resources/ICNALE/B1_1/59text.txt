There are many people smoking nowadays, most of them are males. People started smoking a long time ago. Though everyone knows that it isn't good to smoke, it can't be stopped. Cigarettes have some bad components, which are harmful to your health. According to reports, you have a very big chance of getting lung cancer if you smoke for a long part of your life. Even though we all know about the bad effects that smoking brings to us, why can't we stop smoking? Because there are some chemical components in the cigarette, which make people addicted to it. If the person doesn't smoke one day, he or she may feel uncomfortable and think that there might be something wrong. There is another reason why we can't stop smoking. There are a lot of companies who sell cigars and cigarettes around the world. If the authority made laws to stop selling their products, they may protest to the government. Many of these companies have a great effect on their country and economy, so stopping the sale of cigarettes could have a bad effect on the economy. In order to control the amount of smoking people, the government raises the price of these products, hoping people will stop buying them, but it doesn't work well at all.
