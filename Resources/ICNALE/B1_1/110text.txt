Yes, smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants in the country. Because smoking is dangerous to our health, the government should empower people all over the country to quit to help our environment as well as our bodies. If people do not follow the law, the government should give them sanctions or punishments so they do not to do it again. Vendors should not have any cigarettes in their stores to avoid smoking everywhere, because we all know that smoking is an addiction, and that cigarettes are very harmful to our body because they affect our lungs, teeth, and gums. To improve our health, the government should provide information that our body will become healthy, and not smoking will improve our country and environment. The government should provide good healthcare for the whole country so they can develop their own beliefs about this project. The government should confiscate cigarettes to reduce pollution. All of the funds that they will get can be used to help build a foundation for street children so they can have a proper education. I therefore conclude that the government should impose the NO SMOKING CAMPAIGN across the country.
