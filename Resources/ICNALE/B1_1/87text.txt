Smoking is a very bad habit. As a result of which, the environment is polluted badly. It should be banned everywhere. Restaurants are public places, where people come to eat and refresh themselves. At these places, if smokers come and start smoking, the other people who are eating there are disturbed. Smoke is not only harmful for the smoker but also for other people living around him. This smoke contains toxic substances like nicotine which is bad for human health. It causes also lung disease or respiratory disease. It should be stressed by the administration of the restaurants that it is also place of public gathering where people come to eat, so the environment of such places should be healthy, so that people feel relaxed there. But if the surrounding environment of the eating place is filled with smoke, the particles present in the smoke cause different diseases by directly entering the body and they spread in the food. When people relax in that polluted environment, the air entering their lungs has a bad effect. Smoking is a very serious problem of our society. It should be banned everywhere but particularly in places like restaurants where people come to eat. It should be banned in society because smoking has a bad effect not only on the smokers but also on the people living in their surrounding environment.
