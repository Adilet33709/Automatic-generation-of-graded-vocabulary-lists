I agree with the statement because part-time jobs gave me lots of experiences. For example, I learned the following things through part-time jobs. It is hard to make money because I have to go to my part-time job on the day and time that I promised, even if I don't want to. I have to be on time because if I am late, I interrupt my colleagues’ jobs and make bad relationships. I can't stay self-centered because guests choose the restaurant which they want to go to, so I need to make them comfortable when they choose my shop. I learned from part-time jobs about the importance of making money and making relationships. But I learned it is tiring to have job at the same time. I need time to rest and recover. So it interrupts my study to have too much work. I agree with having a part-time job but it is better to work during long vacations like summer or spring vacation, because students’ first priority is study and part-time jobs should not interrupt their study.
