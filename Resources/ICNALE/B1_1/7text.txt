Nowadays, it is not uncommon to see university students doing part-time jobs. However, I don't think it is important for students to have a part-time job for several reasons. According to research done by the Chinese University of Hong Kong, University students who have part-time jobs have shown a decline in the performance of their studies, as they are often distracted by their jobs. Some may even make being a truant a habit since they are tired after working. Some may argue that students who have part-time jobs can earn money on their own, and thus can become financially independent and help relieve the financial burdens of their families. But this is not the case, since many students who have part-time jobs seldom pay tuition fees by themselves, and they would rather use the money they earn to buy luxury and pricey products that their parents can hardly afford. So, their parents still need to pay their tuition fees and give them pocket money. This will make students more and more materialistic and brand-addicted. Lastly, students may become demotivated in their studying. When they have a part-time job, their timetable will be so tight that they don't even have time to hang out with friends, and they will eventually become disconnected with their friends and feel isolated. Hence, they may lose motivation to study because they are not happy with their school and social lives. Therefore, I don't think it is important for university students to have part-time jobs.
