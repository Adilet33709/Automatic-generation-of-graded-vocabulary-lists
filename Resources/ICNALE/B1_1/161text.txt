In order to be an independent adult, we have to work in our student life. We will get much money and experience, and we will learn how to live in the world. For example, I have had three part-time jobs in my school life. My first part-time job is as a guide. My work involves taking Japanese tourists around Taipei City. I love traveling, so I enjoy the part-time job. It's interesting to me. My second part-time job is a cram school teacher. I have to teach junior high school students geography. The work is more difficult than my first part-time job. I have to help them improve their geography test grades. If the students don't learn the subject, I will receive complaints from the students' parents and the other cram school teachers. I not only have to ensure high geography test grades, but I also have to edit the new geography textbook. It's not easy for me. My third part-time job was a sales clerk at KFC. The work was busy. I had to clean tables, introduce set meals, and fry the chicken. I hated the job, so I quit after 3 months. Although I had some bad experiences, it's still important to me. These experiences are important in my life.
