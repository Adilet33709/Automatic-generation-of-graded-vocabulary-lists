According to a recent study, second-hand smoke does more harm to nonsmokers than to smokers. Therefore, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I'm not a smoker, and most of my friends refuse to breathe second-hand smoke in public places, such as at schools, department stores, and restaurants. Second-hand smoke causes air pollution and makes nonsmokers feel uncomfortable. The government should pay attention to this issue. Smoking not only harms the smokers but even does more harm to non-smokers. While smokers' bodies have adapted to the adverse effects of smoking, nonsmokers don't have this advantage. Restaurants are public places where everyone can visit. Smoking should be banned in the restaurant, so smokers need to obey the regulations and respect nonsmokers who don't want to breathe in the second-hand smoke. The most important thing is that our government should make laws about smoking in restaurants. Those people who smoke in the public places such as department stores, schools, and restaurants should be fined. A team should be established to catch smokers who smoke in public. It is the best way to protect nonsmokers from second-hand smoke.
