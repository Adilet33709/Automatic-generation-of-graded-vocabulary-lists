It goes without saying that smoking has a bad influence on our bodies. If we keep smoking for a long period, we may be addicted to it as a result of the substance in the cigarette named nicotine. It is possible that we will be too addicted to quit smoking by the time we realize that smoking is such a terrible thing, unless we have the great determination and willpower to overcome all the difficulties we may face while quitting smoking. Besides this, smoking will weaken our lungs and increase the probability of suffering from lung cancer. If we suffer from lung cancer, it will make not only ourselves uncomfortable but also our family unhappy and worried about us as well. The worst thing is that we may even die because of it. Moreover, when smoking, we produce a substance which is so-called "second-hand smoke". Second-hand smoke affects the people around the smokers, making their health become bad. They may also get the same disease and suffer the same consequences as smokers. To sum up, cigarette smoking is really bad for our health. As a consequence, we should never smoke, no matter what kind of conditions we are in. In addition, we should persuade our family members who are accustomed to smoking to stop doing it.
