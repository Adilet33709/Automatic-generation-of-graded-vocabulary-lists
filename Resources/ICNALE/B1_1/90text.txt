There has been lots of controversy about whether University students should concentrate only on academics or have a part-time job for income or to gain experience. In my opinion, they are both extremely essential for our future careers, so I always support students doing some part-time work before graduation. According to a survey, many employers in Hong Kong point out the main problems with fresh graduates are their lack of work experience and communication skills in talking with strangers or clients. The benefits mentioned above could be gained by effectively having a part-time job. It is well-known that Universities have already set up a platform to provide many resources for students, like summer internships in Hong Kong or overseas. So students should treasure their valuable time during summer break and winter break by equipping themselves for their future. However, I definitely discourage students from doing part-time jobs during the study period. It should be noted that the first priority for them is to seek knowledge and not waste most of their time in gaining a limited amount of money, especially to those waste their pay on meaningless entertainment! Apart from studying and working, students should also widen their social networks in University by participating in extra-curricular activities. Work hard, play hard!
