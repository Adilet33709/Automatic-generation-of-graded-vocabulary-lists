As we know, smoking is not only harmful to people's health but also harmful to the environment. Smoking can lead to many diseases, such as cancer of the lung and so on. So it is very important and necessary to stop people from smoking in public places, especially in all restaurants. There are two reasons for that. The first one is that restaurants are public places where people have meals, so keeping the air clean is the duty of everyone. Smoking can generate dirty smoke to pollute the surrounding air. There are a lot of harmful substances in the smoke; it is no doubt that harmful substances will stick on food and then they will be eaten by people. So you can imagine how unhealthy the food will be. I think no one would like this environment when eating. Secondly and more seriously, the people who sit around the smokers have to breathe second-hand smoke, which is more harmful to their health than smoking is to the health of smokers. Smoking affects non-smokers more than it does smokers. The ratio of second-hand smokers getting ill is higher than that of smokers. So smokers should think more about other people, and should not maintain their habits over others' health. All in all, I agree with the government in banning smoking completely at all restaurants in the country.
