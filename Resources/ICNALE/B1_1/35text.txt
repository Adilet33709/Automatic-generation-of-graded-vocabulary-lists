A part-time job can be an alternative way for college students to earn money. Students who have a part-time job are independent students because they aren't only studying their lessons in college but they are also working to get a salary. They can spend their free time at a part-time job so they can pay their finances in college. They want to earn their money without hoping for money from their parents. It is important for college students because I think college students can be independent people before they graduate from college. By having a part-time job, college students can get new experiences outside of college. They will use those experiences after graduating from college to do a better job than other people. They hope after graduating that they won't be awkward in the working environment because they already gained work experience before graduating. I really believe that college students who have a part-time job will be successful because they can use their time for studying and working hard. They have already learned how to earn a salary for themselves without depending on their parents for money. They can manage their life without have to get money from their parents. Many companies look for people who have experience of a part-time job because they are not awkward when they work at the company, and they can do the job very well. In this globalized world, all college students need to use their skills, not only hard skills from their college but also soft skills from their experience outside of college.
