I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. The main reason is that smoking is harmful not only for smokers but also for non-smokers. There are two types of tobacco smoke: firsthand smoke and secondhand smoke. The former is absorbed by smokers and the latter passively by non-smokers. If smokers have bad manners, smoke floats into the air. At first, restaurants are places where people gather and enjoy eating. The food tastes and smells good. If smoke is present in the restaurant, it reduces the dishes’ taste by half. Although people have the freedom to smoke, they may not harm others’ enjoyment of their meals. In fact, smoking has been banned from 10:00 to 14:00 on holidays in the doughnut shop where I work for a year. The is the peak time when people gather. I feel that more families with children come to the shop compared with before. It shows that more people dislike smoking. All people can enjoy meals equally at any time in any place. In Europe, most countries ban smoking in restaurants. Following Europe, it needs to be banned in Japan too.
