College students need lots of money because they have to pay tuition fees. Also, they need to pay for transportation and they have to buy lunch. All these expenses are a very big deal to students. Registration for school is very expensive. Many students receive money from their parents, but it is limited. Therefore, having a part-time job is required of students. Students can help alleviate their parents' worry by doing a part-time job. Even if students are busy with school work, they can feel satisfied. In my case, my parents give me money once a month. I have no part-time job. I have to spend money reasonably price all of the time. Sometimes, I want to buy brand-new clothes or an expensive bag, but my wallet has a limit so I can't buy things that are written on my wish list. If I had a part-time job, I could buy clothes or a bag. However, having a part-time job makes me tired and very busy so I don't want to have a part-time job. Gathering money is easier for me than earning money. On the other hand, summer vacation and winter vacation are exceptions. In my free time, like on vacation, I will find a part-time job because I'm free!
