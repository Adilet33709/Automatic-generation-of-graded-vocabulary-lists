It is well-known that smoking is a bad habit that is harmful to your health and appearance. The government has already set up many laws to prevent the next generation from smoking, like raising cigarette taxes and prohibiting teens under 18 from buying cigarettes. Frankly speaking, it is the right time to secure non-smokers from inhaling the smoke released by burning cigarettes in public areas. Try to imagine, how would you feel if someone smoked when you're having a wonderful meal with your lover in a restaurant? I think the smoker should respect others in public areas, especially restaurants. If smoking is not completely banned in restaurants, it will absolutely affect different kinds of people. For customers, apart from the health problem and mood, the smoke will also decrease their appetite, and as a consequence many dishes or food may be discarded. In the case of restaurant owners, their revenue may greatly decrease due to the loss of non-smoking customers. Even for smokers themselves, there is a big chance the cigarette ash will disperse on the food’s surface. This is extremely dangerous, as cigarette ashes contain many toxic substances such as tar and sulphur derivatives. As a result, I totally support the government banning smoking in all restaurants.
