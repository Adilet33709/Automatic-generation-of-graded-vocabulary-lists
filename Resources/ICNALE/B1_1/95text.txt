Smoking should be banned in all restaurants because cigarettes are dangerous to our health. Smoking is fatal, and many people know that smoking can cause cancer and other illness. Smoking worsens asthma; having asthma myself, I avoid people who smoke. Smoking should be banned in all restaurants because restaurants are for people who want to eat, and not for those who just want to smoke. Cigarettes have many chemicals, and if those chemicals  get into the food, we will eat them and they could cause illness. If we don't smoke, we can prevent cancer and illness. Smoking does not just have ill-effects on the smoker, it is a public health hazard. Second-hand smoke is dangerous when a person is constantly exposed to it, but just one exposure can be dangerous for people with pre-existing conditions. Addiction to cigarettes is both mental and physical. Cigarette addicts do physically crave cigarettes, but they are also addicted to the act and the lifestyle. Banning smoking in restaurants will discourage customers who enjoy smoking while they eat or drink alcohol. For smokers who go to restaurants often, this will be an inconvenience which will have positive effects on their health, whether they like it or not.
