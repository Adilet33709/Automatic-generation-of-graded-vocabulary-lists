I am partly for the perspective that all the restaurants in the country should prohibit smoking. As you know, a restaurant is the place where people have their meals. The most important thing for a restaurant is to keep the environment clean and the dishes tidy. If the guests smoke in the restaurant, he or she will probably pollute the surroundings. Worse still, they might drop cigarette ash on the tables or the dishes. Accordingly, it is necessary for every restaurant to prevent people from smoking. Only in this way can we have a better environment for our meals in the restaurants. However, there are possibly some bad effects from this ban. On the one hand, smoking is the sign of a man. The relationship between smoking and men is as important as that between make-up and women. Thus, a man at a restaurant, especially during the time of dinner, seems to be superior to others. They may feel that smoking is representative of their social status. On the other hand, people like businessmen sometimes smoke at restaurants in order to cope with some difficulties and carry out negotiations smoothly. All in all, I partly agree with the point of view of banning smoking totally at all the restaurants in our country.
