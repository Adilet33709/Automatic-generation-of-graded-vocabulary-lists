“Smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country”. There is a part of me that agrees with this statement, and a part that does not agree. I agree because, as an individual who does not smoke, it is very annoying for me to smell and inhale the smoke coming from cigarettes. Moreover, in the kinds of restaurants we have in our country, the smell of smoke will last because they are fully air-conditioned. Yet on the other hand, while I do not agree, there is no law that says smoking is banned in restaurants. A lot of people smoke for relaxation and/or for their metabolism, and others smoke because they just can't resist it, it is their hobby or part of their daily routine. However, I always think about how they can continue smoking while seeing others who can hardly breathe when they inhale the smoke coming from their cigarettes. Everyone should care about each other. Maybe one of the best solutions in that people should be held responsible for smoking in restaurants or public place to decrease the number of those who get lung cancer, the risk of those who have asthma, and to decrease the pollution in the air. The best solution is to quit smoking, get a better hobby, and live a healthy life.
