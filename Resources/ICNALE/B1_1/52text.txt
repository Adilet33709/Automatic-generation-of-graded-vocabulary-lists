I have tried to work since I graduated from senior high school, not only during vacation but also while I studied for my exams. There are no other reasons for working, except that I am poor. I have to earn my living by looking for a part-time job and doing well. Actually, my free time is almost all gone. When I leave school, I have to run to my office. I have tried telephoning at cram schools or standing on the street all afternoon to distribute DM. I have little time to join my friends' activities. I left the ball team because I could not handle it. Sometimes I hate that I have to work, but I also find new fun in my part-time job. I can practice my conversation skills while being a waitress, and I can be friends with many other students like me, and I learn many experiences that I can't learn in school. I have also found a way to balance both my school and my job. I can use my time well to do each thing. I don't think it is important for college students to have a part-time job because not everyone can handle both in his college life, but if you have the ability, you can train yourself and gain achievement in different areas. It's useful for your future work.
