Many people smoke at restaurants today. It is very unpleasant and I hate it. If I see people who are smoking when I am having a meal, I will be very angry. I also agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. There are two reasons why I hate people who smoke at the restaurant. First, smoking is not good for our health. As you know, many people know this truth and smoking affects other people as well as the smoker. Many non-smokers are suffering from secondhand smoke. Therefore, banning smoking from all restaurants is the only way we can prevent the dangerous effects associated with smoking. Second, non-smokers cannot enjoy their meals at restaurants because of smokers. When I was having my meal at a restaurant, I couldn't eat anymore because of cigarette smoke in the air, so I stopped eating. As always, many non-smokers are suffering because of smokers. In conclusion, smoking is not good for human health, as you know, and we should protect non-smokers by banning smoking from restaurants. It is a very important thing and smokers should also not bother non-smokers. So, smoking must be completely forbidden at all restaurants in the whole country.
