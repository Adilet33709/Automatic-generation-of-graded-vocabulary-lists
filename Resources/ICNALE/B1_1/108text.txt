Many college students have a part-time job today. It is very common and many students have part-time jobs. As a student, I also agree that college students should have a part-time job. I will talk about my opinion why I agree that. First, college students will get experiences about social jobs. They can experience hard and good things. It is very important because social experience is very useful to all people. When they are adults, they will have to work and earn money. During their work, they will meet many people and will be faced with hard times, so meeting many people and building experiences are important. Second, they can get their own money. They can buy anything that they want to buy without their parent's help. Further, they can help their parents as they pay their tuition. If they earn money during vacation, they can get much money. Lastly, they can feel a sense of accomplishment as they do their work, so they will work well in the future. In conclusion, as they have a part-time job, they can get social experience and help their parents. They are also able to fulfill themselves through their part-time job. So, it is important for college students to get a part-time job.
