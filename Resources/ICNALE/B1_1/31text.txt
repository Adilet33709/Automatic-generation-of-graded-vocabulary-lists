First, students should be able to focus on their studies, so that they can get a better position in society. However, there are some financial problems, due to which students are compelled to work to earn their expenses. In this way, they can neither study nor work. As parents are responsible for their children’s study expenses, they should provide their children with all facilities of life that they require at that age. But in our society, due to financial pressure, the students are compelled to do jobs. As a result, they fail and cannot achieve better results in their studies. Some of these students are very talented students. If they are provided with every facility necessary for them at that age, they can do well in this society, but if any student belongs to a family which is very poor, they have to work. There are some students that do not feel their job is a burden on them because they want to share the responsibility of their parents. Poverty is the main reason why college students do part-time jobs. No doubt, due to their jobs, their attention is divided and they cannot perform properly in their work but they can maintain their position in their class. Some students do jobs because they want to live independently. Some students do their jobs by choice. So, part-time jobs for college students are not too essential; however, there is no problem if they want to do them.
