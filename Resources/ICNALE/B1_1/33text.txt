I agree with this opinion. There are some reasons. First, it is important for college students to learn how difficult it is to earn money. If students don't have a part-time job and they only study and enjoy their free time, they never experience the importance of earning money. Second, they can meet a lot of people through a part-time job. In college, people who come  are almost the same age. Probably, there are other college students, or women who have children, or people from other regions etc. These people can know many things that you don't know or you won't learn at your college. So you can learn not only at school but also at the place you work. Third, if you experience many kinds of work through a part-time job, you can learn what work is about. And you can imagine how you want to work. The time that you are college students is only a few years, but you must prepare for the future before you graduate college. So having a part-time job is very important. I think that having a part-time job is as important as studying in college. If students spend much more time on their part-time job and they don't have enough time to study, they should reduce the time that they spend on their part-time job.
