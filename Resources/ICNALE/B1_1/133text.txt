We all know that smoking is dangerous for our health, but we are now becoming even more aware of just how bad smoking is. It is a hard habit to stop because tobacco contains chemicals like nicotine, which is highly addictive. As with heroin and other addictive drugs, the body and brain quickly become used to cigarettes, so the person needs them to feel normal. Some think smoking is cool and a way to become popular. Other people start smoking because they are influenced by their family members or friends. Smoking should be banned in all restaurants in our country because if many people continue to smoke, for second-hand smokers, exposure has a possibility after many years to cause cancer or heart disease. This is because every time we inhale cigarette smoke, we inhale extremely harmful chemicals. Smoking can also influence other people to smoke cigarettes because they can see you smoking, especially teenagers. If smoking is banned in our country it will help us a lot. It will protect our health, reduce health risks, protect non-smokers and children, and that's why smoking should be banned across the country.
