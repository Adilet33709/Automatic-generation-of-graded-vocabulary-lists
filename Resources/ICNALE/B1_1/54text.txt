The argument of whether smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country has been under heated discussion. I will show the different opinions below. Those who are in favor of the idea claim that we all know that cigarettes contain many harmful materials that can cause lung cancer or other incurable diseases. As such, it is very harmful to smoke. On the one hand, smokers will waste a lot of money on buying cigarettes. On the other hand, smoking is harmful to both the smoker and the people who smell second-hand smoke. Further, there are also many examples of people who have suffered from diseases owing to smoking too much. Thus, for the benefit of smokers themselves and other people, it is a wise choice to ban smoking in restaurants. Those who are opposed to the ban hold that smoking is a personal habit just like some people’s habits of reading or running. As such, others have no right to interfere. Besides, a restaurant is a place for people to eat meals and relax in, so smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants. As far as I am concerned, my favor goes to the former opinion. If the policy is successfully implemented, we can enjoy our meals in a healthy environment.
