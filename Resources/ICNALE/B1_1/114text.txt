Now many parents and teachers disagree that college students should have their own part-time jobs because they believe that students will spend their study time on working. But I do not think so. I think a part-time job is one of the most important things in college life. It will be the precious experience in your whole life for several reasons. Firstly, a part-time job is a good way to fill your spare time after class. Many students spend time on shopping, singing or playing computer games, which are pointless. Why not take a part-time job instead of participating in those entertainments? You can even earn some money from the job by yourselves at least. Secondly, a part-time job can add to your career experience, which is a very useful part in your future life after you graduate. You will learn much knowledge that cannot be found in school lessons. Social experience is the biggest advantage for graduated students when they interview for jobs. It's easier to find jobs for those who have accumulated experiences in part-time jobs. Thirdly, as a matter of fact, a lot of college students are from poor families, so taking a part-time job for them is one of the ways to afford their college fees. Although the money may not be enough, that is all they have earned by themselves. From what I have said, it is important to college students to have a part-time job. Studying must also receive our attentions, so we should balance the part-time job with studying well. After all, the first job of students is studying.
