I think smoking in public places is a bad habit of many people because it makes breathing uncomfortable for many people around that area. I really do agree with this opinion because smoking should be considered bad manners. People think it doesn't have any disadvantages for anyone, while it affects people such as children, women, pregnant women, and everybody who doesn't like it. In the case of smoking in restaurants, I think it is a big problem. That is because restaurants are places for eating, partying, or having some special time to make good memories. Therefore, there really shouldn't be smoking in these places, but if some restaurants don't have to ban smoking, I think a good way to solve the problems is the manager of the restaurant should provide a special area to smoke. However, smokers should be aware also. They can go out of the restaurant to smoke so it will not be a problem to everybody in restaurant. Don't forget that smoking is not good for everyone, while it is a bad thing for many people. Therefore, I do really agree with the topic and I do support restaurants banning smoking in their area.
