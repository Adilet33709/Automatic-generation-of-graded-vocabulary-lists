I agree with the point that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are reasons why a part-time job is important. First, it can improve our abilities which cannot be learned in class, like communicating with each other. Second, every company that you want to apply to consider real job experiences as a very important thing. So when interviewing, you will gain advantages over other people by owning a part-time job. Further, a part time job is really a preparation for one's future professional job. However, as a college student, the study of textbooks seems very important, and we have to take all kinds of tests. Doing a part-time job may have a negative effect on the score of tests, and may cause very serious impacts. If your scores are low, you may even lose the ability to graduate from school. Working at a part time job may influence you to see the negative side of our society, eventually causing a negative effect on your mind. Thus, I think it is very important to balance our part-time jobs with our university life. Getting high scores while doing a part-time job is a task that not everyone can achieve. As such, we should give up the part-time job at a certain point.
