Some people think that teenagers having part-time jobs is bad, because they think part-time work is a cause of their low grades. They even think that the teenagers who have part-time jobs are delinquent students. I think they are prejudiced. Teenagers with part-time jobs can learn about economic strength. Besides, part-time jobs have some other benefits for teenagers. So, in my opinion, having a job when they are still students is a good way for teenagers to learn about society. Here are some reasons that why I agree with the teenagers having their jobs. First, teenagers can know the value of money as they earn money themselves. Most of the teenagers and children get pocket money from their parents, but they don't do anything in order to earn money. They don't know how much their parents worked or where the money comes from. If they have part-time jobs, they can know about these things. So, part-time jobs can help the teenagers to take care of their money. Second, they can learn about many people and personal economics. For example, teens working in some place like 'Starbucks' can see a lot of different kinds of people. Some people are younger than them, but many other people are older than them. They can learn modes of speech, ideas, and attitudes. By doing this, the right values can be established in them. There are many good places where teenagers can work: convenience stores, fast food restaurants, parking garages, etc. Teenagers can learn worthwhile things through their part-time jobs in a way they cannot through textbooks or by doing assignments. Therefore, I agree with teenagers having part-time jobs.
