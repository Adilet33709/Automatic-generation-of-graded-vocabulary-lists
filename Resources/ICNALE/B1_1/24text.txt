It is very important for college students to have a job while in college because it goes a long way to equip students with job experience while they are still in college. By the time a student graduates, he will stand a better chance of getting a job than other applicants who have little experience, if he has a job while in college. Part-time jobs also go a long way by helping students to gain practical knowledge of what they are being taught in school. When we have a part time job during college, it also equips us with new knowledge regarding professional ethics and codes of conduct at our work place, which is an experience that may come in handy later in life. A part-time job can help you pay for living expenses, including housing, food, books, gas, and clothes. As you will eventually have to pay off any school-related loans that you take out, it is best to take out as few as possible. Lastly, it is always good to have money. While money may not be the most important thing in life, it does buy things such as food, heat, and a roof. It buys things like college degrees (brains are needed for those too) but overall money is a pretty important thing to have, and I would definitely say that those without a job are lacking in money and responsibility. All college students should attempt to get a job while in college and they should earn their own money to support themselves.
