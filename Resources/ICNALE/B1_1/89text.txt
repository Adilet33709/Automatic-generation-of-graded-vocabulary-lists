Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. It has been proven many years ago that cigarette smoke harms our health, especially secondhand smoke. Everyone has the right to be healthy and stay away from the harms of smoke. One may argue that smokers also have the right to smoke. However, banning smoking in restaurants does not affect their rights. There are many open areas for them to smoke while in restaurants, and with the closed environment and long stays, non-smokers have no way to escape the smoke. Therefore, this policy benefits non-smokers while it does not affect smokers at all. Also, we have to argue that this policy be applied to all restaurants, as opposed to just some. From time to time there have been long discussions about this issue. During that period, some restaurants decided to prohibit smoking, but soon they lost a large portion of their smoking customers. Some gradually gave up and stopped being a non-smoking restaurant. As a result, a no-smoking environment was hardly achieved for many years. When laws were passed to prohibit smoking in all public indoor areas, this situation totally changed. Since smokers can find no substitute, they have to give up smoking in restaurants. Under these fair conditions, restaurants do not lose customers at all. Finally, banning smoking in restaurants may increase the difficulty of smoking. Some smokers may consider giving up smoking. This is definitely another advantage that we could think of. Therefore, all reasons support smoking being completely banned at all restaurants.
