I totally approve of the point that it’s important for college students to have a part-time job. As current college students, we should take an active part in the part-time job, if we accomplish our studying tasks first. With the constant development of the economy and society, everyone, including students, is faced with great challenges. Many students who graduate from university cannot find a satisfying job. They also suffer from great pressure. Having a part-time job can benefit students who will enter into society to some extent. First of all, students can improve their other abilities through the work experience. Moreover, they can familiarize themselves with the society in depth. Besides, students are informed of the fact that society isn't favorable to everyone. Those who long for great success and an enjoyable career must exert themselves to study hard. In this sense, students are alerted about the hardship through the part-time job. Take me for example: I once worked as a waitress in a small hotel. During this period, I had to serve customers and take their orders. I served dishes and rice for them, and I was rather tired during these days. Though the pay was low, I was excited. I learned that everyone should spare no efforts to do something if they hunger for a better life in society. I will commit myself to studying hard. All in all, there are important advantages for college students to do a part-time job during their time in university.
