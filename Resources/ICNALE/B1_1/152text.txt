In college, there are many activities to do such as learning subjects, doing research, making appointments, taking tests and quizzes, reading papers, etc. The college student should do activities in college because they will help the students learn, play, and work together appropriately. Some departments of the student's college are hard to graduate from and get good grades. This is because the student may spend much time or share time when they are not at college, such as weekends, holidays, long holidays, Sundays, etc. They might divide time properly and spend time together with other people such as friends, teachers, or in other places. In my opinion, having a part-time job in Thailand is not important for every college student. The students should do main tasks and there are many activities to do in the student's life before having a part-time job. If you have some free time, you may do a part-time job. I think just doing activities in the student's department and college is enough for the college student so it is not necessary to have a part-time job as a college student. A part-time job can be done anytime but tasks and activities in college may only be done once or at a certain time. Part-time work may make you waste your effective progress in college.
