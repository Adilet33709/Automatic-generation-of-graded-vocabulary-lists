Nowadays, many things have changed. There are things which fade, but new things emerge. New high-tech gadget are continuously being invented and released in our society. There are many good things that have changed society, but some have been harmful. The never-ending graft and corruption problem and the economic crisis have led to the suffering of innocent people: families, children, and even students. Let's take a look at students, due to poverty, some go to school and some do not. It is important for college students to have a part-time job, not only to help themselves, but also to help their parents who work hard. Maybe some college students don't want a part-time job, thinking that it would be hard for them to have a job and at the same time go to school. Yet, as a college student, it would be better if the majority of students try to have a part-time job. First, it could help financially. Second, you'll be able to help your parents by providing for your needs if they can't. Lastly, you will become a good role model for students as they can  recognize that you are a responsible person. Having a part-time job is not a disgrace, and it is not a reason to put down a student. For me, a part-time job should not only be for students who do not have much money, but also for students who do have money as it can teach them that money is not just a  thing, and make them realize that they should be responsible, study hard, and be wise by spending their money in useful ways.
