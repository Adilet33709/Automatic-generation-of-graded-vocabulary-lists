Why do many college students decide to have a part-time job although they could only learn and use their free time to rest? Some students must work a part-time job because of their family's finances, while others work a part-time job because they want to. Personally, I think it's important for college students to have a part-time job. First of all, the students that have a part-time job can get some money to share in the work of their family and they can develop many important skills to become a good worker, such as responsibility, punctuality, and self-command. They also learn how to work with other people and gain much experience from older workers. Most importantly, when college students graduate and want to find a job, the students who had a part-time job in the past are more interesting than the others who did not. Especially, for the students that had many part-time jobs for many years, it's proof of their diligence. However, some students who have part-time jobs brush away learning on campus. They must remember that the reason why they are students is to learn to find good work in the future. In my opinion, I don't think that having a part-time job while learning makes any problems if they use their time wisely. In conclusion, I think that a part-time job is the first step to success.
