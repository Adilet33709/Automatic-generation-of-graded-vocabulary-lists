I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Every knows that smoking is not good for us. The smoke contains many kinds of chemical compounds which can cause cancer. If we don't smoke, we still can be threatened by smoke. Because the guy around you could be a smoking-man! There are many medical evidences showing that the harmfulness of second-hand smoke is greater than first-hand smoke. When someone smoke around you, maybe you will walk to you, tell him "Excuse me, sir. This is a non-smoking place. " Usually this guy would throw out his cigarette and say sorry to you. But sometimes it is not so lucky. This man could say "Why? Why not you go away?" At this time, the government made a law to restrict the right of smoking man and protect those non-smoking people. The law says one can not smoke at the place which has more than three people. Banned place is included with restaurants. If someone abandoned the law. He will be fined at most ten thousand NTD. Based on the reason of health, smoking should be banned in public place such as restaurants. If we don't do this, we would suffer from health problems caused by smoke. So next time when you eat dinner at the restaurant, no one will smoke beside you.
