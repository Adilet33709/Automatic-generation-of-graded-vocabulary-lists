Many people believe that both having a meal and cigarette is the way of social life and doing business. However, while it is well known that smoking is bad for human's health, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First of all, under the second-hand smoke environment is worse than smoking by them. Restaurant is a place for family, any kind of people even kids and pregnant women to have a nice meal. If you allow people smoke during the meal, it's not only very rude to other guest having meal with you but also hurtful to other customers sitting in the same restaurant. Second, all those customers who don't smoke might stop coming to the restaurants which reduce the income of the restaurants and make them shot down easier. The taste of food would be destroyed by having smoke at the same moment as well. It is not a really proper way for enjoying a nice lunch/ dinner. Last but not least, smoking is not a requirement during the meal. Normally people want to smoke after the meal instead of during the eating process. If people want to have a more relaxing conversation by having a cigarette, they can also go outside or some other places such as lounge bar. Smoking in a restaurant is not only an impolite behavior but also cause other customer's bad influence on their health. To sum up, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
