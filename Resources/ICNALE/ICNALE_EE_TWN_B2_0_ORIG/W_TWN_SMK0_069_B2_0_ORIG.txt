I disagree on the idea that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. Even though smoking is harmful to people who smoke, and also to people who don't smoke but are around, I think we should still respect the smokers' need. To explain it in a simple way, people gain happiness through different kinds of ways. It just happens to be a harmful way for the smokers to gain happiness. It may urge them to quit smoking if the government practices the ban, but to those who haven't succeeded in quitting, it could be a torture if they can't find any place where smoking is allowed except their homes, and further problems might be raised. There should be a substitute plan: Smoking should be banned at the common restaurants, except those with smoking areas apart from non-smoking areas. Second, the number of restaurants with smoking area should be limited. Third, any violation on the rules should be heavily-fined. Government should put more effort on educating people, to prevent the non-smokers start smoking, and providing help for the smokers to quit smoking before implementing such strict legislation. It is important for the government to think of a proper policy that makes both the smokers and non-smokers better off.
