From my point of view, I think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job during their college period. The following are some reasons why I consider having a part-time job is better. To begin with, going to a college is like a preparation for establishing your future career. Students learn and study knowledge for what might be useful one day. If you can have a part-time job while you are studying, you can learn more efficient from not only the textbook but also from the real life experiences. In addition, having a part-time job can help you to gain respect from peers and establish relationship with others. Take myself as an example; I was once working in the National Theater as a receptor. I learn how important it is to communicate and listen to costumers. I became more eloquent when talking to others for I needed to give specific orders to my peers to help them accomplish some tasks. In fact, participating in both school and work was pretty exhausting. The tight schedule nearly made me fall to pieces. However, after the tough period, I can embrace challenges instead of giving whenever I am facing difficulties. I became more patient with people, welcoming any criticism. In conclusion, having a part-time job can help college students learn more efficient with lots of experience and handle pressure well with patient and welcoming criticism. As a result, it is important to have a part-time job for college students.
