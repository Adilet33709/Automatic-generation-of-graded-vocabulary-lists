Smoking is really a strange thing for me which confuses me a lot. Every time I stand at the bus stop waiting for the bus' coming, walking on the streets or even standing in front of a restaurant waiting for my meals, I often can smell some bad and disgusting smell which comes from some other passengers' smoke. "Disgusting second-hand smoke again!" I can help but feel uncomfortable immediately owing to the smoke. "How can people be fond of smoking and even have to smoke a lot everyday?" As far as I am concerned, smoking does no good on people. Not only does it harm your health and your lung, but also it takes you so much money to buy the smokes. You have to face the risk of getting lung cancer, spending a lot of money, and even are hated by some other people. Then, why do the smokers can't stop smoking? I think some smokers can't quit it because it makes them feel relaxed and even addicted in it. Therefore, it seems hard for those smokers to quit it. And for some teenagers, they may think smoking is a cool thing and start to have the bad habit. However, I don't think people should keep smoking no matter what the reasons are. Smoking can not only harm your health but also harm others'. And it also makes the city more unclean because of the deserted smokes which are on the grounds everywhere. Therefore, for everyone's health, the city's environment and saving money, I think the smoker had better quit the bad habit as soon as they can.
