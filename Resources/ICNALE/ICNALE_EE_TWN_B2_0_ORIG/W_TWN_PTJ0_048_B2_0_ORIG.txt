It depends on the person's need. Different students have different needs. For a rich one, they do not have to consider whether they have money to live or not. However, for a poor one, having a part-time job is very important. But there are some students will have a part-time job in order to get job experiences. For me, having a part-time job is quite important. My parents cannot send too much money for me as allowance, so if I want to buy some new stuff, go to the restaurant or go traveling, etc. I have to deal with the spending myself. But having part-time jobs is not only to earn some money as allowance but also to get some experiences. Therefore, I always make myself have two part-time jobs during each semester. One, the key-in job, is for my daily lives, and another, school office helper, is for the experience. Both of them are simple jobs and can earn 95 NT dollars at each hour. Although, having a part-time job, for some students, is quite important. Safety is also important. That is why my two part-time jobs are both provided from my school, NCCU. The importance of having part-time jobs is different from different students. As long as you need, then just go to find one. But we college students all have to remember not only taking the responsibility to the job but protect ourselves
