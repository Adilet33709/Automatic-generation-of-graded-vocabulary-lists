Part time job is an investible part in my college days. Since I studied in University, I have taken many kinds of jobs during the college days. From waitress to tutor, there are so many jobs I have done that sometimes I couldn't remember all of them. For me, there are some reasons why I took so many part time jobs and what part time jobs mean for me. First, I have to earn my own livings. Since my families don't have the ability to support all of my life expenses, I have to make some money to support my own life. Therefore, I took many jobs to earn enough money for life. Second, I can have different experiences and learn some things from them by taking different jobs. Since I have done many kinds of jobs, I have learned different experiences from them. For example, I learned how to cope with my tutor students and the teaching skills in the tutor jobs. In addition, I also learned how to treat customers in a suitable way when I was a waitress. These experiences are really meaningful for me. The last reason is that I can make different kinds of friends from different jobs. And it's really interesting to have some chats during the working time. Part time jobs take a great part of my college life. Though I feel tired or frustrated because of them, I can't confess that I do learn a lot and get mature from these experiences. Therefore, I really can't imagine if I haven't done any part time job, what my college life will be.
