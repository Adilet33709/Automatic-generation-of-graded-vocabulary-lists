Although some people think that university students should concentrate on their study and they should not take part-time job; however, I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are many advantages for university students taking part-time job. First, if they take part-time job which is related to their major, they will understand more about their major and future job. For many high school students in Taiwan, they just choose their major by their grades or they just choose it according to their parents. Some people find that they dislike their job after they started to work in the field. However, they already spent years completing their bachelor degree and it may be too late for them to study another major in the university. One of my friend's major is accounting. After she had internship in Ernst and Young, she realized that she does not want to work in the Big Four in the rest of her life. Another advantage of taking part-time job is earning money and local economics. There are many old opportunities for university students to be a home teacher. Students can earn money while children in Taiwan can have better education. According to some surveys, teenagers are more likely to spend money than people. As a result, if university students cannot take part-time job, there will be a negative impact on local economics. In conclusion, university students have the right to have part-time jobs. Since there are so many advantages for students taking part-time job, I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
