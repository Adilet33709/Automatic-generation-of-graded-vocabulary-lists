I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. The answer might be the opposite before I got two part-time jobs this summer. After working from 9 am to 7pm in the place where I work now, I find several reasons why it is important for college students to work part-time. First, by working part-time we gain different kinds of working experiences before we graduate and work full-time. Full-time jobs mostly require professional knowledge and skills and it is more serious, thus it is more difficult to change your job once you are on the position. What part-timer needs to do is often less professional. When you are applying a part-time job, there should be more choices. And by doing different kinds of jobs you gain different kinds of experiences, which is precious because it might be a help to your future career, for example you might learn some professional knowledge through the work, and from various kinds of working experiences you might determine what you really want. Secondly, by earning money on our own, we would spend money in a more careful way. It is common for young people to spend money on something unnecessary. Part-time jobs usually are not high-paid jobs. By being paid based on the working hours, we realize how uneasy it is to earn a living and thus build correct concepts on money. Still there are some more benefits by working part-time, such as it is a help to those students that face economic pressure. To sum up, I think as long as students are able to use their time well, that is, part-time jobs wouldn't influence their studying, it would be beneficial to students if they have a part-time job.
