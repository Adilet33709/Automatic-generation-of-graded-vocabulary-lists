I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are several reasons. First, you can earn money in your own. When we grow up, the entire bill about studying was paid by our parents. Usually one enters the college at the age of eighteen. Eighteen years old means you are an adult. You should share the economical load of your family. You can use the money to pay for your registration and learn to be independent. Second, you can learn how to deal with problems encountered in your work. When you solve these problems, you can get experiences. Those experiences will one day help you when you graduate from school. Last, you can make friends from your work. A good friend will be help of you future work, especially when you are in trouble. He can save you when you need help. But as a student, your primary goal is get good grade to pass the exam. So don't spend too much time at part-time job. You need time to study and go to class. Try to distribute your time among class, part-time job, playing and rest! Those things must be balanced. Or you will be regret in the future.
