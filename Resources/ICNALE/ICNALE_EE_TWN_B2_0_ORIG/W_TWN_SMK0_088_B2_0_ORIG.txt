I, who don't smoke, completely agree with that. In my opinion, smoking don't bring any benefit, it's totally a bad thing. Smoker shouldn't smoke in the restaurant. In restaurants, it's hard for them to have completely separated smoking and non-smoking sections. If one person smokes, then everyone around him has to breathe it. Also, the waitresses in a smoky bar or restaurant will suck entire boxes of cigarettes just from breathing the dirty air. For people who don't smoke, it's hard to stand it. Maybe people who smoke will think that it's nothing. But for people like me, we don't smoke; we think smoke is really stinky. Furthermore, when we suck the second hand smoke they produce, we may have higher risk to get cancer. Smoking is bad for our health. When people smoke, the smoke they produce will also cause air pollution. Everyone wants to have a good environment when having meals. I think people shouldn't smoke when having meals. We should ban this in the country. Having meals is a pleasure thing. But when people smoke during that time, I think most people won't feel good. It's really important to ban this in the restaurants. I totally agree with that.
