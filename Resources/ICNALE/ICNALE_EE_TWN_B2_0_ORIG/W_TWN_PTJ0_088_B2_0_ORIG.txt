Having a part-time job is a good thing for students. It can not only make students learn some work experiences but can make them more independent. But for me, having a part-time job isn't very important. Nowadays, more and more college students have part-time jobs. When the class ends, students usually say that they are going to work. They work so hard that they don't have time to relax themselves. Because of the work, when friends ask them to go shopping, they always turn them down. If you always absent, friends will not invite you next time. Finally, you will become lonely. Besides, many students get jobs after class. After finishing jobs, it often is late. When they get home, they don't have energies to review their homework. It makes them get lower grades in the class. Furthermore, because they are out of energy, some of them even sleep during the class. It's not worth if you get lonely and get bad grades just because of the work, Before you get a job, you should take care of your schoolwork first. Students should behave as a student. I think it's not very important for college students to get part-time jobs.
