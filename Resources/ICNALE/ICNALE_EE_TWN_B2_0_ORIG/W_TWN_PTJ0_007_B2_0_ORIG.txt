I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job; first, college students should be responsible for their behaviors, not to rely on parents all the time, even on daily life spending. They can earn a living by taking part-time job, so that they will know earning money was not as easy as they thought. Once they have taken a part-time job, they will be more careful when spending money and be more responsible for their behaviors. Second, by taking a part-time job, they can make friends with who have the same interest with him. For example, if you take a job to be a seller, you will meet someone who is outgoing and also loves to interact with people; if you work in the kitchen of whatever restaurant, you will meet someone who also interested in cooking or baking. So no matter what kind of job they take, they can always find someone who shares the same interest with him. Last but not the least; through the job, students can learn something which cannot learn in school. Such as, how to interact with costumers and what to do when being complain, how to work perfectly with co-workers and also the boss, also, they will know which ability they lacking of, so they can learning even harder during free time or school. With those three reasons, I totally agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
