Although some people think that smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country; I hold a different opinion on this issue. First, everybody knows that smoking is not only bad for those who smoke, but also for those who do not smoke. This is very unfair for those who do not smoke. They do not like the smell of smoke, but they still have to bear it and their health conditions are affected. The only way to protect those who do not smoke is totally banned smoking to all the restaurants in the whole country. Second, more people's lives will be saved by doing so. My grandfather did not smoke at all, but he died of lung cancer. It was because that many of his friends smoke. If this law could come earlier, many people would not die of lung cancer. Third, restaurant is a place of people to have meal instead of smoking. Those who smoke should not come to restaurant to smoke. If they want to smoke, they should go to smoking area. Jump to the conclusion, since a lot of survey already pointed out that smoking is bad for people's health, we should have strict laws to restrict this bad thing, or more people would die of second-hand smoke.
