Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As we all know smoking hurt our body it'll lead to lung cancer, making our teeth looks dirty, and also having a bad smell. More seriously, smoke not only harmful to ourselves but also the people who surround us. The second-hand smoke caused those innocent people having no choice but to hurt them. It is kind of unfair. Since you are the one who enjoy the smokes, and the nearby people will also be the victim. Some would even say that "you can leave to avoid the smoke, it's your choice. " Think of having a superb dinner in a restaurant, company with the great music, perfect wine, and with all your kids surround. What a lovely photo. However there is a guest who was smoking and goes by. All you can felt is the stinky smokes, and lose all your appetite. Your first thought is to leave immediately, but it's really a pity to leave all you gorgeous food there. And since you are not the one who does wrong, it's not your fault. The smokers are the one who should be blamed for! Therefore, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
