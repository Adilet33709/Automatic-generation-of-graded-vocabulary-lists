I disagree with the claim that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Instead, there should be a part of restaurants maintained for the smoker. The supporting reasons are as follow. First, smoking is a basic human right, even though it may do bad to the smoker's and others' health, we cannot forbid one from smoking. Therefore, restaurants allowing smoking provide spaces for those who want to enjoy eating and smoking at the same time, and then these places can further gather those who smoke together and leave those who cannot bear the smell of cigarettes a comfortable place. Moreover, smoking is a special culture, and we should not wipe it out from the diverse society. Some restaurants provide the water-smoke devices, and smokers gather together to share that habit, and tourists even come to visit that kind of restaurants. If the place of sharing a habit disappears, then the culture about the habit is hard to keep. Still, unlike drugs, which in a little amount can lead to people's severe and immediate damage of body and the loss of working ability, cigarettes are not so dangerous, only by a large amount of smoke do cigarettes harm people's health. To sum up, smoking is more a right and a habit than a danger. Smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
