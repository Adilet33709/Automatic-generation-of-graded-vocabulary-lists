My answer is "YES. " Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. The first reason is that if someone smokes, some smell produced from the cigarette, and the person's surrounding will smell bad. The bad smell certainly ruins the great meal and the mood. And the second reason is smoking ruin people's health. Nowadays, more and more people die because of the lung cancer. Some of them are addicted to smoking, but some of them are just having too much second handed smoke. Smoking not only make people get cancer but also make the smokers' teeth becoming yellow day by day. That way, no matter how handsome he is or how pretty she is, when he or she smiles, their teeth will scare many people. The third reason, is my personal opinion, is I do not like to be with a guy who will smoke in front of me. The bad smell really makes me difficultly breathe, and also makes all of my body, my hair, my clothes, etc, smell bad! I think government should teach those who smoke to quit smoking, and the smoker should learn how bad their behavior is. So I completely agree that smoking is banned at all of the restaurants.
