Smoking is extremely harmful to health. It is harmful to not only the smokers, but also the people around them. Because of this, smoking is banned at most of the restaurants in Taiwan now. I don't think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Restaurants should have the rights to decide what they do. They can welcome the customers who smoke, or they can put a ban on smoking. However, restaurants should have a post on the door to let the customers know whether they can smoke here. If a person who doesn't smoke sees the post that smoking is permitted in a restaurant, he would not go in and have a meal. Reversely, if a person doesn't care the smell of smoke, even if smoking is permitted in a restaurant, he can still have a meal there. Besides, restaurants can be parted into smoking area and nonsmoking area. To sum up, the most important thing is that restaurants should mark clearly whether customers can smoke in the restaurant. Then customers can decide where they want to go. If a restaurant loss their customers by letting people smoke, they would afterward put a ban on smoking. Hence I don't think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
