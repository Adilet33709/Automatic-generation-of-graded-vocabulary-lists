It is no doubt that smoking should be banned in all restaurants because smoking is a selfish behavior. It definitely affects others and is annoying. When nonsmokers are forced to second hand smoke, it is not fair and affects health. People who are going to restaurants want to enjoy their meal not second hand smoke. Also, we need to consider the rights of the catering workers. Their jobs are serving people not inhaling second hand smoke. Their health are deteriorating if the smoking ban is not applied. Because they need to works all days long. The inhaled concentration of smoke is thousands times of the smoker. The smokers need to stop and be more considerate. Moreover, smoke particles will stick on the food which makes food poison because smoke particles are carcinogenic. It worsens the food qualities and looks. When you pay for your meal but it ruins your health. Is it worth it? Some people argue that we can set up a smoking zone. But don't forget that smoke particles can diffuse from a high concentration to low concentration. It is no use of setting smoking zone. It is only deceived the stupid guys. So, I agree.
