It's not uncommon for a university student to have a part-time job. They may as a private tutor, salesman, bank officer and so on. Someone argued that students houdl be focus on their studies in university and should not have a part-time job. They said doing a part-time jobe would make them less focus on the lessons and spend less time on doing homework and revision. However, in my point my view, it is important for university students to have a part-time job. Firstly, part-time jobs help university students to enter the society. After their studies in the university, students will need to start to work in the society. Doing these part-time jobs can help them to gain working experience and learn some specific abilities that will be useful in finding a job after their graduation. In addition, part-time jobes help university students to earn a living for themselves. For a university student, they usually need to star at their hall due to the far distance from their home and university. The daily meal fee and hall fee is a heavy burden for them. It is a good idea for them to have a part-time job to lighten their burden. This also can help them to be independent to earn money by themselves instead of asking their parents for money. To sum up, doing part-time jobs has more advantages rather than disadvantages for university students. Therefore university students should have a part-time job.
