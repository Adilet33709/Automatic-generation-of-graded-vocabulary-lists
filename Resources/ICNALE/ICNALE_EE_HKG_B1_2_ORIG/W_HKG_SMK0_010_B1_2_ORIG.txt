The issue of banning smoking has been argued in this decade, and this has been in the hot seat recently. I think smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants, as the cigarette contains different kinds of harmful substances shown in many discoveries and some of the substances may cause tumors and lead to death. The cigarette also contains some chemicals, making users addict to it. Air pollution may arise in addition to smoking. Some people may be annoyed by the smoke that being breathed out, especially at indoor area, in which the area is less ventilated. However, some may argue it should not be banned at all restaurants, for example, the restaurant managers, since it may affect the flow of customers, including smokers. As they may argue that some of the customers may choose not to go. Also, there are some difficulties in defining the area of the restaurants if the laws are made, such as the sitting area outside the restaurant and the outdoor catering area, and another problems may arise in related to the penalty of violate the laws. In conclusion, I support with the idea of banning smoking at all restaurants, but there are still some unsolved aspects have to be tackled in order to be in the regulations.
