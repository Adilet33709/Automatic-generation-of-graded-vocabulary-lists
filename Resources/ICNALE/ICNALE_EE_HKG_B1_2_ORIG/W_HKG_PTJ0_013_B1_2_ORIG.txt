Nowadays, university students have to study different subjects in depth in order to have a better preparation for going into society. Therefore, studying hard is especially important for university students. However, university students should not spend all of their time in studying. It is also important for university students to have a part-time job. First and foremost, university students can earn money from the part-time job. There are plenty of expenses in the university life, for example school fees, living fees, expenses for entertainments, social activities etc. As most of the activities are costly, university students have to spend a large amount of money to join them. However, it is difficult for university students to have a full-time job to earn money because they have to study. Therefore, having a part-time job to earn money is the best choice for them. University students can have a part-time job in their spare time, for instance a part-time tutorial class. Thus, students have extra money to resolve the financial problem and hence reduce the financial pressure of their families. Hence, having a part-time job is essential for university students. Moreover, a part-time job provides working experience for university students. It is difficult for university students to get a job after graduation but without any working experience. Therefore, if university students have a part-time job, they can reduce the time that they need to spend and hence they can get a job easier after graduation. In conclusion, it is crucial for university students to have a part-time job for earning money and getting experiences.
