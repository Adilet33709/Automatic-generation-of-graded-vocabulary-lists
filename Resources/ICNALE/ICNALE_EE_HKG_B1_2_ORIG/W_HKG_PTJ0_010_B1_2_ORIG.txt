Personally, I do not agree with the statement of it is important for university students to have a part-time job. In my opinion, students should put their studies in the first place, as these are the main responsibility of being a student. As a student, he/she should be able to cope with his/her study very well, before making any other decision. If he/she was unable to handle his/ her studies, how would he/she be able to manager his/her time well? Another reason is because of the time consumed for a part-time job. I think this aspect is related to which types of part-time you are doing. I had a classmate, who worked in a pharmaceutical company as a part-time job. He usually worked for 3-4 full days in a week, in which I think it is unacceptable. So I think it is less important for university students to have a part-time job while they are studying. However, some may suggest that having a part-time job is important as some may need to earn their livings. Some may also argue it would be good opportunity of gaining experiences before working in the society, as some positions in some of the companies are required for such. Generally, I do not agree with this idea in some extent, due to students' own responsibility and time and afford paid in having a part-time.
