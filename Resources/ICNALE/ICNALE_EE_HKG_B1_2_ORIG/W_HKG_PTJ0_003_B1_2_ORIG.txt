There are many students think that having a part-time job is important for them since they can get the experiences of working and earn money. In my opinion, it is not important for university students to have a part-time job. In my point of view, having a part-time job in the school is rather less important than getting good academic result and joining different schools activities. There are three main reasons. First, university study is already our last 3 years of studies in the whole life. We should study well and at the same time joining different activities. It is time-consuming for us to have a part-time job. Second, job experiences can be earned after we have finished the university studies. There are much of times left after the end of our studies. Third, it is not necessary. Between scholarships and the support from parents, students should have enough cash to live on without having a part time job to earn extra money. In conclusion, I think that we should treasure the remaining time of studies and the chances for us to make new friends. Therefore, i don't agree that it is important for university students to have a part-time job.
