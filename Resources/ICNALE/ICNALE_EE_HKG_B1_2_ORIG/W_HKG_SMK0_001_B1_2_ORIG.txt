As we all know, smoking is a bad habit, it affects all people who don't smoke, so I agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants. Some argues that smoking has several benefits, such as help the body and mind relax, help to concentrate on study or work, and some even say that smoking is legal so people should respect the rights of smokers. However, those smokers always ignore the fact that the nasty smell of smoke and the toxic substances released from cigarettes is harmful to others no matter how smokers argue, people around smokers are forced to breathe in second-hand smoke, it shows how selfish are those smokers. Reports from different medical research already found that those smoke and toxic substances may cause cancer, including lung cancer. No matter do smokers mind the potential danger of having cancer, they should not ignore the right of others of avoiding those substances. Smoking in kitchen can be even more dangerous. When people smoke, ashes may drop onto food being prepared and it is very harmful to our health. Secondly, without enough care, lighted cigarettes may causes fire in kitchen, which is a serious threat to customers in the restaurant. So I again agree and suggest that smoking should be banned in restaurant because of health issue it may cause.
