In these few months, the government is trying to introduce a new law to ban smoking in all restaurants. In my point of view, I think banning smoking in all restaurants is really necessary. First, I think it is a must in order to protect citizen's health. It is well known that cigarette is carcinogenic and can induce many health problems. The harmful substances can easily spread by the smoke. If one person smokes in a restaurant, all other costumers, waiters and waitresses may inhale the harmful smoke. Some people suggest building smoking rooms. However, the waiters and waitresses still have to enter the room to serve the customers. Therefore it is a must to ban smoking in all restaurant to prevent citizens' health from being harmed. Second, this can prevent the arguments about the definition of'indoor' from occurring. Many arguments about this keep appearing. I think it is very difficult to define a restaurant is'indoor' or not as different restaurants have their own design. I strongly believe that this problem will never be solved unless a new law is established. Because of the above reasons, I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants.
