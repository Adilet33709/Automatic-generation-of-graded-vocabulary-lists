Most people are still working even though they know it will be bad for their health. Unfortunately, not only the active smokers but also the passive smokers will receive the negative effects of smoking. This is the main reason why smoking should be banned at all restaurants. Both active and passive smokers share the same deathly risks, including, but not limited to stroke, heart disease, brain damage, and cancer. These passive smokers would be saved from these deadly issues by not allowing people to smoke at all restaurants. It can also disrupt human respiratory system by inhaling the smokers. Besides, there are bad impressions about smokers. their teeth are stained, their gums are rotted, and the odors of smokers are unpleasant. These conditions discomfort the passive smokers. As an example, a passive smoker like me would prefer to eat in the non-smoking section at any restaurants. Non-smoking sections are usually cleaner than smoking sections. Smoking section contains smokers and tobaccos ashes which will discomfort me. It would be better if there is a rule that banned smoking actively at all restaurants rather than creasing a smoking and non-smoking sections. Since there are many passive smokers at al restaurants, smoking should be banned.
