It is essential for university students to have part time jobs because they can earn more experiences. As they are the future pillars of the society, they need to prepare themselves well to contribute to their country. Also, the can be more mature enough to handle the difficulties in their future working environment as they are well experienced. It is a gateway to them to be a successful person. Taking part time jobs is an another all round education for students as they can learn about interpersonal skills which cannot be learned from books. Also, communicating with their counterparts or boss is an important element for their mental growth because our students are very brittle and fragile. They have received education since they were young. It is a high time for them to apply their knowledge into working environment. They can earn more money for their daily expenditure as the school fees and living costs are very high in universities. They may not need to grant loans from the government and become financially independent. It can reduce the burdens of their families and the government. I strongly agree that students need to take part time jobs since there are lots of advantages.
