To be more competitive after graduation, nowadays university students have to better equip themselves, not just with the academic knowledge, but also with the career-related experience. As a result, part-time job would be the best choice for us. After entering the university, we can have time to work as a part-timer, but we should prevent being trapped. Thus, it is vital for us to check the background of the target companies- what they do, how the wages are paid, etc. We must get these safety precautions done before we find a job, which is also a main task we should be carefully treated in the future. Then, we should take our own responsibility, which means we should not just focus on what we can receive from the corporation, instead, we should think what we can give. Each opportunity can turn out to be a great experience, together with the practical knowledge that are different from academic studies. So, we should grasp all opportunities and put every effort in accomplishing the missions. Part-time jobs are important to our future career and to our life, let's get start now!
