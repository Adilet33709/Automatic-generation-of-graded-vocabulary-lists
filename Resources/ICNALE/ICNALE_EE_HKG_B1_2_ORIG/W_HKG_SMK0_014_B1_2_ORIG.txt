According to a medical research, smoking causes a wide variety of adverse effects to human health. For example, it is related to the number one fatal disease, lung cancer. It also leads to a high incidence rate of heart diseases. Thus, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. To begin with, everyone have the freedom to choose. Nicotine and Tar in the cigarettes may cause serious health problems, which may in turn affect working efficiency. Other people are innocent. They should not be succumbed to the secondhand smoke, because they have the right to choose not to suffer from the fatal diseases, and some are even allergic to the particulates. Considering the space of restaurant, usually the ventilation system is not good enough to get rid of all those particulates or main ingredients in cigarettes, so these substances are free to flow around, and others are forced to inhale in these'devil'gas. As I have mentioned, there are plenty of outdoor areas for the smokers to choose, but if they'invade' the indoor areas, others have no place to hide. Smoking affects others seriously, so it should be banned completely at all restaurants.
