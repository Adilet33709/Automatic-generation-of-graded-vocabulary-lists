On 1st January, 2007, the government announced that smoking in the indoor area is prohibited. However, smoking in the restaurants is not included in this category. The restaurant owners claimed that banning smoking in the restaurants will affect their business and fewer customers will be willing to come. On the other hand. according to a research to a newspaper, eighty percent of the customers agree to ban smoking in restaurant. In my opinion, smoking should be banned in the restaurants. To begin with, smoking in the restaurant will affect other customers. The non-smoking customers are supposed to have a good and comfortable environment for them to enjoy their food and talk with their friends. Smokers in the restaurant will provide second-hand smoke and make the environment unpleasant. Furthermore, smokers will create a lot of dirt in the restaurants. Some smokers will leaver their cigarette and ashes on the floor. This will affect the cleaness of the restaurants. The owner of the restaurant will need time to clean it and this dirty environment also make a decrease in the number of their customers. In a nutshell, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. This can benefit to both the owner and the customers of the restaurants. The government should set up lawas to ban and penelize the smokers in the restaurants.
