Smoking has a lot of disadvantages. Smoking jeopardizes people's health, causes unpleasant appearance, or even more serious harms the relationship between the family members. Moreover, restaurant is a public area that different kinds of people can go into. Therefore, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants for the sake of the mental as well as physical health of the public. First of all, smoking is an activity that endangers people's health. As the major component in the cigarette is tar, nicotine etc. All of them are harmful to human body. At the same time, people who do not smoke but having meals in the restaurant absorb the second-hand smoke from the smokers. The results of inhaling second-hand smoke are as serious as smoking. Even worse, the chemicals inside the cigarette can cause a lot of diseases, for example heart disease, high blood pressure, cancers. The consequences of those diseases can be fatal. Therefore, smoking should not be allowed in all restaurants in order to prevent having fatal disease. Furthermore, restaurant is a public place that everyone can go. If there is some second-hand smoke present inside the restaurant, all of the people inside the restaurant are forced to inhale that harmful smoke. Hence, the health of the people is in danger. Thus, smokers should not be so selfish that smoke inside restaurants. To sum up, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants for the sake of the health of the public.
