Recently, there are more and more people smoking in Hong Kong, though smoking has been proved as an unhealthy habit. As a result, whether to ban smoking at all restaurants has become a controversial issue. In my opinion, although whether to smoke is one's right, non-smokers who are sitting in the same restaurant should by no means be forced to inhale any of the smoke. Smoking should immediately be banned at all restaurants in our city. As we all know, smoking leads to severe illness like lung cancer and heart disease. And, when one smokes, the air around must inevitably be contaminated with all these harmful smoke. Therefore, the customers nearby have to smoke with the smokers. Let's imagine, if we take 3 meals everyday at restaurants and spend 30 minutes for each, how much smoke will we breathe in and how will our health be affected? The only result is our health deteriorates. What is more, the deterioration of our health will lead to heavy workload to the public hospitals, and lead to a higher death rate. Therefore, the public's health should under no circumstances be sacrificed for the selfish behavior of the smokers. That is, smoking must be completely banned at all restaurants.
