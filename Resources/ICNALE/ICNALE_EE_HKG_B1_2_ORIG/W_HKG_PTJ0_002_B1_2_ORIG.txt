Most university students do part time job because they want to earn more money for them to afford entertainments, buying fashionable clothes, hanging around with their newly met friends in the university. Most of the people may think that those students only focus on earning money, expanding their social scope rather than their study in the university. Whether it is important for a university student to get a part time job depends on what he or she wan to get from it. University students are already adults. They should have ability to determine the importance of having a part time job. For me, it is important for me because I would like to earn more working experience during the university life so as to well prepare myself for adapting the society after I have graduated for the university. However, I will always put my study before part time jobs since the main purpose for me to be a university student is to get further education on my major subject and all round development. It is definitely stupid for us to just focus on earning money and left our study and school life behind.
