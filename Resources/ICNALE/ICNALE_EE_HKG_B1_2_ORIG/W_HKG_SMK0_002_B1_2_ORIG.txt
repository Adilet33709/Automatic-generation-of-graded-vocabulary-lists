The purpose for the HK government to ban smoking in restaurants is to reduce the number of smokers so as to improve the health condition of Hong Kong citizens. Base on this purpose, it is reasonable to completely ban smoking at all restaurant including pubs. From the point of the smokers, the ban can restrict them from smoking whenever or wherever they want. They will be only allowed to smoke in their homes. The inconvenience brought by the policy will probably force them to give up smoking. This method surely is much more efficient than just persuading them via the TV advertisements. On the other hand, It is passive smoking that causes large amount of deaths every year in the world. Passive smoking cause especially bad effect to children's development. Rather than just health problems, there are studies found that passive smoking also harm the intelligence of children. The more chance for kids to contact passive smoking, the higher chance for them to have poor intelligence development. Complete ban of smoking at all restaurants can reduce the chance for people contacting passive smoking. Also, it is important for maintaining consistent for the policy. It is not fair for the government only ban some kinds of the restaurants but not all.
