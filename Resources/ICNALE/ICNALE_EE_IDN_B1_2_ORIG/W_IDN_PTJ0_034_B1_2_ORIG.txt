Since we were born until graduated from high school, our parents have supported us in financial needs. Even while attending college, we still use our parents money. But not all the students are relying on their parents. Some are working part-time as teacher for elementary students, junior high school students, or senior high school students. Working part-time does not mean you have to be a teacher. But there are many other jobs. We can look for it in the internet or ask for help at CAC (Career Assistance Center at our university). Or, we can ask a recommendation from friend who is having part-time job. Working part-time doesn't mean we have to work while we are studying. We can work part-time when it's holiday. So, we don't waste our time with lazing around, not knowing what to do. With working part-time, we can get some activity to do and also we can get money to lessen the burden on parents. Working part-time also will give us experience. However, later we will be looking for job to fulfill our needs. We can write our part-time job in our CV. So, it's important for us as a college students to have a part-time job. Although, we can't fulfill all of our need, we can learn to be independent.
