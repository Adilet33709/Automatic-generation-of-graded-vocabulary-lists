I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because smoking has a lot of bad result. Smoking is bad and extremely dangerous for our health. People usually going to restaurants for food not for smoking, they want healthy food not a bad food. Perhaps not only banned in restaurants but also in the public places. Many people feel disturbed when they are eating they also disturbed by the smoke flavored. Because they can't smell the food. Smoking should be completely banned because there is no benefit from smoking only bad for our health there is no gain from smokers but only pain. Second-hand (passive smoker) smoke is more dangerous than active smokers so that it is so detrimental to people around. Many people have suffered from the cigarette smoke, people with severely damaged lungs and heart because of smoking and passive smokers. Small children are vulnerable to cigarette smoke bad for their growth, health, lungs and heart. Smoking only doing a lot of harm to people around especially when they are eating, because some article said that when we are eating we also inhale the smoke.
