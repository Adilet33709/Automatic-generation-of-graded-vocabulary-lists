There are three reason why I agree that a college student should have a part time job. First of all, They will learn how to manage the money effectively. With worked as a part time, they will get more money and they can commute their parent's burden with help to pay their school. It is not only money that the student must be able to manage effectively. The student will learn how to manage time too. They will learn to divide their time between work and study. This way, they become an expert in time management if they can balancing part time work with their studies. So, all their time won't be wasted because of doing activity that is not too important or not productive. And the last, the student will get more friends outside the university. It can be hard to meet people when at university or at least a different crowd of people. But If you work outside the university, you will meet lots of new people, making new friends which can be refreshing when university becomes a bit stale and suffocating. Some people may disagree with me, but I believe there are more benefits for people who work part time while studying.
