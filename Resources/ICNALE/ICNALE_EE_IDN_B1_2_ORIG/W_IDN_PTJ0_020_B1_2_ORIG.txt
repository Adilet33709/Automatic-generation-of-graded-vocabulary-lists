I think get a part job while study, is depend on the person. If she/ he wants to gain money or get more experience I think it should be okay. But, when we are really busy, no time and easily tired. It is not better choice. Get part job has a negative and positive opinions. In positive : you can get more money for helping your parent, increase your income, get more experience, get more friends and more independent for take care your self so you can be mature. And the negative area is : you easily for tired, spending many time for work, and less time of study. If you want to get good mark, I think we should think twice about take a part job like this? Can we manage our time, and can we maintain all of this, although we should think twice about our body health.. because take a part job is pretty difficult when you can't manage it in the right side. If I must choose one of this.. I will not. Because It is pretty difficult from me to manage my time, and actually I am easily tired. Despite, I didn't have any goals in my major (accounting ) like getting a good Final Exam mark or etc, I just doing all of this as usual. Take a part job like this just spend my time and myself into risks. So I absolutely refuse about this.
