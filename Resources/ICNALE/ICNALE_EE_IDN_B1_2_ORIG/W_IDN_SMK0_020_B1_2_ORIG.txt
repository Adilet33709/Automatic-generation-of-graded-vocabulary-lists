In my opinion being a smokers harms our body, and absolutely I hate smokers around me. Despite my father is a smokers and I really stay away from him when he was smoke. I'm pretty confuse by the people smoke around the places like terminal, mall, bus etc. In my mind, I always think about them, did they realize people among them? Definitely they never think about that and they don't have any respect for this.. I have a lot reason why we should not smoke. First, smoking just affect our health and we must spend a lot of money to buy some cigarette, and definitely we know being a smokers damage our lungs. And you can get some disease like cancer and reduces the length and quality of your life. And the others reason is you are out of respect for the people around you, and that is pretty disturbing. When you smoke, you not only harm yourself but you also harm all the people around you. So you must be selfish. If you love yourself especially for man, please stop smoking!! Think about the people around you, who love you, likes your friends and your family. I'm sure they won't to see you suffering or sick because of that thing. You just spending your life, your money, and the important thing is you will spend much money for medicine if it going worse. So you should think twice for decide to stop smoking. Because we had dreams for our life.. And from my article, I am really disagree about being a smokers and for some people didn't have any respect for their self and others people.
