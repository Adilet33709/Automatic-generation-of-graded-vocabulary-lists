Nowadays, college students are allowed to take part time jobs while studying. The type jobs are varies from shop clerk to cleaning services. Personally I think that these part time jobs are important to college students. As we can see, not everyone in this world is rich. The same applied to college students. Some of them can not their education fees and may need to have additional income source. One of those sources is by doing part time jobs. Part time jobs allow the college students to earn money without neglecting their studies. It is an effective solution for students with monetary problems Besides money, part time jobs also give work experience. When we are entering the world, experiences are a good asset for us. Those assets can be gained by doing part time jobs. For example: waiter. In some restaurant, we can see many part timer works as waiter. Those waiters can get communication experiences while they serve the customer. Part time jobs also can increase some essential skills. One of them is time management. Part timer must manage their time so their work schedules are not crashes with their college schedule. Also they must know when to take a break for learning and doing projects. This way they can learn how to manage their time effectively. Part time jobs can be helpful for college students. It can give additional income, experiences and building our skills.
