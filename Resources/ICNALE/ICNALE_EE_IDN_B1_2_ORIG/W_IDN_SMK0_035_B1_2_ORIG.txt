I agree smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. As we know, smoking is not good for our health. First of all, cigarette contains nicotine that can damage our lungs and make us hardly to breathe. The government also gives warning to the smoker to make less the smokers. We can see the warning in every pack of cigarette, and it is said that smoking can cause cancer, hypertension, and also disturb fetus. Smoking not only inflict to us, but also to other people. Smoke makes the no fresh air and sometimes people that not usual with it can cough when she or he suck in it. If smoking is not banned, it can annoy other people that do not smoke that usually called passive smoker. The smoke of cigarettes is more dangerous for passive smoker than active smoker, because the smokes that are aspirated by the active smoker are not good for our health. We must keep our health because we are the next generation on our nation. Besides, we must keep our environment better and make the air still fresh and free from smoke. Those are some reason why smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.
