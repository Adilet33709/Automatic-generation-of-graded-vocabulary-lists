In high school, most of the school doesn't suggest their students for doing the part time job. I think that's because some of the students who was doing a part time job still couldn't manage their time effectively. In fact, their score are decreasing because of that. We are students whose first priority is studying. If part time job give bad effect to our score, I think it is better to stop doing a part time job. But now, we are college students. We have to manage our time wisely. We should consider that doing a part time job can give us many advantages. With part time job, we can help our parent for searching for money. And, instead of collecting money, experience is more wonderful present we got from doing the part time job. Experience can help us doing many things and making a conclusion. Experience is required too in searching for the real job. Nowadays, there are many college students that do part time job beside college and doing well in both college and part time job. If we could do them both, don't be hesitated. Do both college and part time job. It really gave us precious experience we need. It is important for college students to have a part time job.
