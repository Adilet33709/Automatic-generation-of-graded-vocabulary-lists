I feel it is important for college students to have a part time job Important or not important is according to their economy situation, ambitions, and many others reasons. If their parent rich maybe it is not too important because they can paid all of the college cost, and books. But if they are a poor family or middle maybe sometimes they need to do a part time job to add their income, or maybe they want something more. Some college students sometimes have a part time job to fulfill their ambitions to be a richer man, but I think study is more important for college students than doing a part time job. Because the smarter they are the faster they will finish their course, and they will save more money because they not repeat their course, they will ready to face a better job, be more serious than before because they do not need to split their concentration with their part time job and study time. For poor students of course a part time job is important because they need more money to pay for the college cost, for their books, and their transportation. Generally some students do noy take a part time job seriously.
