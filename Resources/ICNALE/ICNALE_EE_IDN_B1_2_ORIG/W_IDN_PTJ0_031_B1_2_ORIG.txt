Part time job for college students are depends on the people point of view. In some countries, part time job are considered as a form of learning to merge with society, learn how the working environment is, and gaining new experience. Indonesia people have many different opinions in part time job. Some think that part time job is not necessary and they need to focus on their college. They think that the experience of working can be learned later after the education has finished. Some parents think that working can disturb the learning process of their children. The other thinks that working can make their children unwillingly continue their study and prefer working than learning. In my opinion, I have two different points of view. Firstly, I agree that working can be used as the media of learning of society. They can see and understand many new conditions, level of works, and the most important thing is to increase their funds. By receiving their own salary from working, they helped their parent indirectly because at least they can use their salary for daily needs. But working is not recommended for the students who already full of assignment and activity. Some colleges force the student to study by giving them a lot amount of task. Some students get into the organization or extracurricular activity such as sports and so on. If they have already busy with their work, it will become a burden for the students if they work. So the conclusion is part time work can be effective for certain people.
