As we know, smoking is bad for our health. But, there are still many people smoking. Once they began smoking, they hardly can stop. It's because the smokers become addicted to it. When we addicted to something, it's hard to get it over. People who don't smoke also can get the effect from becoming passive smoker. Passive smoker inhale cigarette's smokes although they don't smoke. One of effect from becoming passive smoker is lung cancer. So, to protect other non-smoking people, the government set a rule that prohibit smoker to smoke in public spaces, such as mall, university, etc. According to the rule, the mall and other public spaces have to provide some places where the smoker can smoke. At restaurants, there's place that signed as smoking area. Although the area is separated but it can still affect people who don't smoke. This is because there are no glasses separating the smoking area with no smoking area. So, we can still inhale the smokes. Let's take an example when the restaurant is full and the waitress places someone who smoking near our table. It will annoy us because of the smoke. So, I think it's better for the restaurants to not allow smoking in the restaurant.
