Smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. Personally I agree with this statement for several reasons. Smoking bans in restaurants are important to ensure a healthy environment. As we already know, smoking is not good for our health. Too much smoking can inflicts acute diseases like cancer. Even though it is dangerous, many people also tend to smoke. Even though the smokers know the effects, many smokers can not stop smoking because of the addiction. By banning smoke completely, it can help them to stop smoking. This complete restaurant smoking bans can be the first step of reducing number of smokers. Smoking bans in restaurants also important for the sake of non smokers. As we knows, many non smokers are feeling irritated because of smokes. Not only their comforts are disturbed, their health also faces great dangers. Researches have stated that passive smokers are affected more than the active smokers. Passive smokers tend to be affected on public places like restaurants. So I think it is essential to ban smoking in the restaurants. I think smoking should be banned on the public places. And smoking bans in all restaurants in the country can be the first step to make a healthy environment. It can help to reduce the number of smokers and bring ease to the non smokers.
