In Indonesia smoking is not forbidden for most of people and most place. People can smoke wherever they want in public. But in certain place, such as malls, restaurants, hospitals, and school forbid people to smoking. In my opinion, smoking in public places must be prohibited because of the disturbance they cause to others. The research says that passive smokers are 80% likely to suffer cancer than active smoker. After knowing the fact, people start to think how to overcome this kind of problems. For example, shopping centre usually provides smoking area for the smokers. Hospitals are strictly forbid smoking inside the hospital because can cause unfriendly environment and cause more bacterium and virus. Next the restaurant which will be explained more. I will divide the restaurant into three levels, the small scale, middle scale, and large scale restaurants. Small scale restaurants usually allow the customer to smoke inside the restaurant. They didn't separate the place for the customer who is smoking and who is not smoking. Middle scale restaurant such as KFC, Pizza Hut, and McDonalds sometimes give the smoking area for the customer. For the example, they provide the outdoor seat for the customer who smokes. In this scale, usually after the customers enter the restaurant, they will be asked whether they smoke or not and will direct them to the smoking area if they smoke. For large scale restaurants, usually already forbid the smoking. They don't have the smoking area to prevent disturbance for other customer.
