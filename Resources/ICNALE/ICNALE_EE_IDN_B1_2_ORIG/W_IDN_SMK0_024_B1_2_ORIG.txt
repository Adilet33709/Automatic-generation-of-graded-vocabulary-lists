In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned in restaurants at all the country because a restaurant is a general place for people to eat and have their meals.. It is also a favorite place for everyone to hang out with their family or friends. So many people exhaust their time at restaurant. If there is someone that smoke, it will disturb the convenience of people. The smoke of the cigarettes will certainly pollute the environment and endanger the environment, the smokers and even the other people who do not smoke. Some people especially ladies cannot stand the smoke of cigarettes and the smoke will certainly harm them. They may not enjoy the meal or even have difficulty breathing. Also, cigarette is bad for our healthy especially for secondhand smoke. Smoke which arises when a person smokes a cigarette, or cigar is more hazardous to a passive smoker who inhales the smoke being in close vicinity of the active smoker. The smoke being inhaled by the former is unfiltered thereby causing more ill effects. Several pulmonary diseases such as cough, bronchitis, asthma and last but not the least carcinoma of lungs may occur as a consequence of smoking. So, to keep our body health, not only restaurants that should be banned, but the other general place too.
