Yes smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country, simply because not all the people in the restaurant is smoking, it can make them uncomfortable while eating or bonding with their family or friends. Banning smoking in restaurants can attract some customers and help the owner of the restaurant to gain more money because other people likes a restaurant that has a good air while they are eating with their family or friends and by this it may not expose others to secondhand smoke and it may lessen the sickness related to smoke such as asthma sinus infections and heart attacks. In my own opinion smoking should be ban in any places simply because it is not only effecting the smoker but also the non-smoker people around them may cause several pulmonary diseases like cough, bronchitis, asthma and some complications in lungs and heart. Many young people are attracted to this smoking thing because they saw it to the people around them and they think this is a good idea to do, they should be taught that it is not good to their health and other's health. I think all the elders should quit smoking to be a model to the youngster that they can still stop smoking and live a healthy life.
