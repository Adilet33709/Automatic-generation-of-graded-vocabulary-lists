College students are, most of the time dependent, on their parents that sometimes they ask for a large amount of money to buy something that is not really needed. Because of this, college students should have part-time jobs to earn money so that they would not be very dependent on their parents ' money. Part-time jobs can give the students the feel of working and earning their own money and in that way they will know the value of money. Part-time jobs can also be a training ground for the college students in preparation for the future so that after they graduate they are confident that they can survive in the real world. However, not all college students have parents who could support them financially and they can only go to college because of scholarships so they get part time jobs to help their parents financially and so that they would not feel that they are a burden in the family. Being a college student there are a lot of things that we spend on because of education so we need to get a part time job to alleviate some of the financial burden of the parents. It can also help us be more mature in handling money.
