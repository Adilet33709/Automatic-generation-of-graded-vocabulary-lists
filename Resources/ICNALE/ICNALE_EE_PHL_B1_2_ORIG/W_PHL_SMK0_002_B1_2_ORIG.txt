I agree with the band of smoking at all restaurants. Smoking is a bad habit that most Filipinos have. It will cause various diseases, symptoms and abnormalities in the human body for the very addictive. This is a good band to propose as it may decrease the number of Filipino smoker in the country. And it will also clear the air and prevent unwanted passive smoking. It is a good way to limit the smokers ' places to smoke so he/she may get rid of his/her very bad habit. And also to some who doesn't like the smell of those cigarettes, it will give them a place of haven. This will also protect them from passively smoking. Nothing good ever comes out of it, even though some say it's very stress relieving. But of course, a lot of other people will disagree with this so to prevent any miscommunication they should be given a place close for them only. The decision of a person to smoke should not affect the welfare of others. So in simpler and shorter terms, like a phrase I read from a post, "a smoker's poor choice should not affect the health and welfare of others him/her. "
