Yes, smoking is bad for your health but this is only if you do it regularly or you smoke one pack a day or more. If you smoke like one stick per day or just when you are stressed from work, it is okay. Banning of smoking in restaurants in the whole country may somewhat be unfair to some. There are smoking lounge in some restaurants and it is a better way to solve this problem. There should be a separate area for the smokers and non-smokers. In that way, the non-smokers wouldn't be affected and be second-hand smokers. Banning won't be the solution of the problem in smoking. Do you really expect that people will completely follow that regulation? I don't think so, maybe except when there is a heavy consequence. This still depends on the respect and responsiveness of the people around you. In our country, I don't really see people smoking inside the restaurants. I could see people smoking but outside of air-conditioned places. I haven't seen anyone smoking inside the mall or wherever. Maybe smoking can be banned in some of the restaurants who don't have smoking areas, it would be the best. We must also take into consideration those who already gave effort of having smoking areas.
