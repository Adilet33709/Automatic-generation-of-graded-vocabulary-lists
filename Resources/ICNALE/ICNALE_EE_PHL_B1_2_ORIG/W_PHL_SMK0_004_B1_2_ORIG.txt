Everywhere we turn there's someone who's smoking. Whether it may be in the open or inside a building. Smoking is even a trend now among college students. Inside the buildings there are areas made for people who smoke in order to not disturb others. Even in restaurants there are more common areas for smoking than just for dinning in. This should be banned whether they like it or not. Most people smoke but that does not exempt them from very simple rules and policies made. Why mike in a room if it's only use is for eating? It's very rude not only to the dinners but also to the reputation of the restaurant. The toxic smoke from cigarettes not only repels more customers other than reeling them in, no one likes to eat something good while breathing something foul. Others do not want to even be near a smoker, then why eat in that restaurant at all? Being repulsed by it the restaurant's reputation will go down and eventually it will close within a month's time. People don't eat smoke they eat food. Eventually it will be the owner/s of that restaurant that will have to endure all that hardships after the cause of the smokers
