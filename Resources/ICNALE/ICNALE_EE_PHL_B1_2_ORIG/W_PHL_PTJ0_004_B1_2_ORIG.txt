Now in our community in the Philippines it's pretty tough to even get money much less work for it. Here even students are now working just to fulfil their families or own needs. Working part time means that now students are being more mature and are coming of age. In most of our lives, us students just rely on our pocket money which our parents seemingly gives us but sometimes even that is not even enough to sustain us from buying what we want and not what we need. In some schools they forbid students working part time because it would violate the school policy unfortunately it does not stop the students from going to different kind of jobs for extra cash. But working part times doesn't mean that the student needs money to sustain themselves but also their families, there are some cases that when some of the said student's parents cannot afford the tuition of the school the students would likely take matters into their own hands by stopping their education and working part time of occasionally full time jobs. Sadly because of our economy is still not improving for everyone's sake, the students have to work even if they like it or not.
