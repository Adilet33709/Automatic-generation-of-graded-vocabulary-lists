Part time jobs are not a person's priority job; it is just a job that takes up less time than a full time job. Some people who take part time jobs are in need of money but some take part time jobs because they want to give back to society. This is a more common thing for students who cannot afford materials in school. It is also common for young adults who are raising a family and are in need of more income. For adults it may be much easier to handle this, but for working students it may be much harder. In my own experience, I sleep late to finish my projects, but for working students it's more challenging. They have to balance their time well. Many people take part time jobs just to earn money or to earn more, but there are those who take these part time jobs because they want to give back to society. An example of these people may be college professors who already have a profession. An example of this may be an architect. Yes some of them have a lot of projects and earn a lot, but they still choose to teach, to not just earn money but because they love architecture and are passionate about it.
