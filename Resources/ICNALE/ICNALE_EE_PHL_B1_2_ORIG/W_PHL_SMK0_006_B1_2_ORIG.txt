We all know that smoking is not good to our health. There is a lot of effect in smoking like it can cause to lung cancer and sometimes death to the person who are smoking. Not only the person that are using are affected here but also the person who are been inhaling the smoke. According to other people, the person that are inhaling the smoke is more affected here. It is really disappointing that at the age of 13, he or she already know how to smoke. Sometimes they are just influenced by their friends or they just see it to other people. So government made a rule that no one should sell cigarettes to minors. But it is not happening because there are still people selling cigarettes to minors. So when the government knew that other people are still selling cigarette to minors, they decided that If someone will not follow that rule will punished. For today's generation, government decided that there will be a specific place for a person where he or she can smoke. But if I am going to ask about this problem I will choose that smoking should be banned on a restaurant, not in only in restaurants but also in public places, for our own good.
