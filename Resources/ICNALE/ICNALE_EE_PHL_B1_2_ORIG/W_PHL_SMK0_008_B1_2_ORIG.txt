I think it is a good idea that smoking should be banned in all the restaurants because we all know that cigarettes can cause us a liver disease, bad breath and can weaken our ability to think. A cigarette not only affects the users but also the people near with it. It's because of the smoke coming from the cigarette that is exhaled by the smoker and combines through the air and inhaled by the person nearby. The person will gain the Second hand smoke even though it is called the second its effects is greater than the smoker. It is really important to have a no smoking policies to all the restaurants so that the cleanliness in the surrounding and even in the air remains. It also maintains the good comments of the people to the restaurants because smoking in an area makes the place like it is not a formal place. The restaurants have their own rules and one of the most important rule is to serve well the customers and to know the sayings that the customers is always right. This means that in every restaurant they need to become ready in every customer they will have. For example if their customer is a smoker they have to talk with him/her in a good manner to asked permission that they don't allowed cigarettes in their restaurant, or bring him/her in a place where there are no customers that can be affected so that there will be no problem that can be occurred.
