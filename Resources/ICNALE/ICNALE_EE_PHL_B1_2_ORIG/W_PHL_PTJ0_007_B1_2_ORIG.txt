Part time jobs can help you financially especially when you're in college. College tuition fees vary on your course and of course, the school you are going to study at. If the university you are going to study at is well-known and has good standards, the more it is expensive. Though there are universities that offer scholarships, there are just chosen students who can commit to it. Some public schools offer less tuition fees but you still pay them. Having a part-time job can help you especially when you applied to a job that has great amount of salary but as a student, I doubt you're going to find a job that offers a lot of money. Studying while working can cause you difficulties on your time and schedule. It is either you're going to sacrifice time for your studies or your job. Working isn't really needed in college when you still have your parents to support you. It doesn't mean that you'll let them pay until you have children. You'll just have to pay them back by doing little things for them like washing the dishes and stuff, especially when your grades are high. Your parents will really appreciate it. They won't regret giving you the money to study in a prestigious university. So for me, part-time job isn't really needed unless you're family needs money and you have to sacrifice a little bit of time for working in place of studying. You must be determined to do both at the same time.
