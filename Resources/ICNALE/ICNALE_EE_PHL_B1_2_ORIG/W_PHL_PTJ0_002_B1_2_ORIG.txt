It is really up to the college student if he/she can manage both education and work. But if it was me, I would rather study first before applying for a job. As an engineering student it is, and a chemical one as that, it is wise to focus on our education as it is very challenging. With the complicated solutions and diagram graphing to writing essays and thesis, I disagree with students applying or working part-time jobs. Even though, working part-time can give us a taste of what it's like in the working world, it may also drag our grades down due to the overwhelming responsibilities of both school and work. With having two responsibilities, you have less time for recreational activities and even sleep. You will have less time to make or bond with friends thus having lesser social activities. In missing out on these activities, you will lose friends that may be beneficial in the future to help you out. You will not acquire the skill to socialize which also will be needed in full-time employment. You may acquire this skill also in part-time jobs with your co-workers, but of course, it is different talking with friends and with co-workers older in age. I am not trying to take away the privilege of working part-time away from those who really need it. It is just my opinion. If some are able to manage their time well, and are really in need to work due to family problems, then by all means apply for a part-time job now.
