Having a par time job was not easy because at the same time you are a college student. If I am not mistaken there is a time that you forgot what you should do as student like your assignment, report, project, reviewing etc., there is a lack of time if you are going to study at the same time working. Their is also a time that a working student will not have any more interest to study but they rather choose to work because according to them is nice to earn money compare to study for a long year. It is really nice to be a working student because It has an advantage to yourself like you will earn money for you to be able to buy thing that you want, save for the future, pay the expenses you have, help to pay for your tuition fee and it will increase your self esteem. It also help you to build relevant skill and multi tasking skill. Having a part time job help you to feel a sense of dignity and worth. On my own opinion I thing par time job is for student who are more competitive and very flexible in works. And I find it more challenging for the working student to compete in school activities. I think if you really want to help or to earn money I suggested the summer job opportunities because it will not be hard for you and you can focus on what your doing. In my case I 'd rather choose study first than having a part time job to be able to excel more in more in my study and to provide myself an academic excellence.
