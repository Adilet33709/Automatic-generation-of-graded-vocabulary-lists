With the increasing amount of tuition fee in colleges and universities, some parents cannot send their children to college. Having a part time depends on the status of the person. If one belongs to a high status family, his parents can send him to great schools. If one belongs to a low status family, parents cannot send him to schools. Some parents do anything just to send their children to school. Some borrow money and some pay the tuition fee even if their money is not enough to shoulder the other needs. With that, some students just stop studying and just work so that they can help their family financially. Having a part time job is an option to some students who are having a hard time for their family to shoulder their needs. It is a good option to have a part time job among college students because they can earn money to help their family financially while also having an education to have a good career in the future. It is also hard to have this situation. It would be hard for some students to balance their studies while having a job. Students should really do their best in studying while doing their job so that their education and time in working will have a very great value.
