Some people in our society who smoke are sometimes inconsiderate of the people around them. They usually smoke anywhere and anytime they want. They do not know how dangerous it is to the health of the people around them. Second hand smokers are people who inhale the smoke of the person smoking beside them, which is actually more dangerous because you don't get to exhale the smoke that you inhaled. One disease second hand smokers may get is lung cancer. This may be the reason why people want to band smoking in restaurants. It would be very rude to smoke in a restaurant because it is an enclosed space and it's a place made for eating and talking, not smoking. Not many people know this but you have a right to breathe clean air. If you are beside a person who is smoking, you can ask them to stop smoking beside you or to just move to another place. Restaurant owners want to get as much customers as they can get, so sometimes they tend to put smokers and non smokers in just one place. But other restaurant owners are much more considerate than this. They place their smoking areas outside of their restaurants so their other customers are more comfortable. This way it won't be a hindrance to both parties. But if I were to be asked, smoking in general should be banned in all restaurants because putting smoking areas may not affect the non smokers inside the restaurant, but it may affect the other non smokers outside the restaurant. Smoking should be banned for everyone because it doesn't have any health benefits and it only affects the health of the people around us.
