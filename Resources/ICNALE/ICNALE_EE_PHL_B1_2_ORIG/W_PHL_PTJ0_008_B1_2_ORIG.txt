I think it is base on the student situation in life. If a student belongs to a rich family it is not important for him to find a part time job. But if the student wants to become independent he/she needs to have a part time job to sustain his/her needs and wants. Having a part time job in a young age gives the students an extra experience and making him a more mature person. While when a student belong to a poor family it is really important for him to have a job because this can help to lessen the financial problems. The student can also gain an experience that he/she can use when he/she wants to find a job when he/she finishes studying. A part time job gives a student some skill, abilities, and different experiences. The student can develop his/her personality and improve his/her attitudes to other people. While in the bad sides the student studies are affected. The student can't be focused in his/her lesson that he/she have learned from school. It is also bad for the student health in over working his/her body. But of course all of us have a reason on everything that we do. That's why even though there are bad effects we do things for the best.
