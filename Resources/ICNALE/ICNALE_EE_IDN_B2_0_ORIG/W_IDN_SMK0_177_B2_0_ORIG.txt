In my opinion, I (non-smoker) agree smoking should definitely be banned in all the restaurants as it not only has harmful effects on the non smokers present there but also may cause alergic coughing to many people. Besides, many youngsters are fascinated by the act of smoking and try to mmitate it which may later develop into a habit. Smoke which arises when a person smokes a cigarette, cigar is more hazardous to a passive smoker who inhales the smoke being in close vicinity of the active smoker. The smoke being inhaled by the former is unfiltered thereby causing more ill effects. Several pulmonary diseases such as cough, bronchitis, asthma and last but not the least carcinoma of lungs may occur as a consequence of smoking. If it is restricting the right of freedom especially to the smokers but surely this step will go a long way in achieving a healthier life style. Many people who gradually become aware of the ill effects of smoking are turning towards de-addiction centre to get rid of this habit. Even the advocates of smoking in public areas disapprove of the practice when it comes to their off-springs. Witnessing the elders smoking kindles a similar desire in a youngster thereby giving birth to a new generation of smokers. To avoid these evils of smoking and ensure a healthy platform /way of life for youth it is not only our duty but need a necessity of life of the day to condemn such practices if not completely then at least socially.
