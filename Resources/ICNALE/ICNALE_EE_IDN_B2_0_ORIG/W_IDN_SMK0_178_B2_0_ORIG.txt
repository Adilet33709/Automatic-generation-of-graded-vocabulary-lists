According to www. inforesearchlab. com, around 5. 4 million deaths a year in the world are caused by tobacco, while www. cdc. gov report shows that almost 90% of all deaths from chronic obstructive lung disease are caused by smoking, which is rated as number one cause of death in United States. Even without looking at these surveys, we can already see that people around us keep smoking despite the danger and the diseases it cause. Therefore, smoking should be disbanded from all of the country around the world. There are three reasons why it should be disbanded. First of all, smoking is the source of almost all cancer diseases, starting from the most common cancer caused by smoking, lung cancer, to cancer of the esophagus and many other cancers such as kidney cancer and stomach cancer. Second, besides causing many diseases to its user and lead those to death, smoking also give its dangerous effect to the secondhand smokers. What makes it worse is that the secondhand smoke or the passive smoke causes an even more dangerous effect for the people like children and non-smokers and rises up their chance to get cancer. Lastly, smoking also has an environmental impact to our earth and surroundings. Cigarette butts that are discarded to the ground and did not get picked up ends up in the river where fish eat them mistakenly, the smoke from cigarette contributes to global warming, and it also polluted the air around us. That is why; looking at the dangerous effect from smoking, smoking should be disbanded for our better good.
