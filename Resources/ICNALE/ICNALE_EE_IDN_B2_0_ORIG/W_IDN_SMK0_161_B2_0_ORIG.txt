Smoking is never a good thing for many people, especially in public places such as restaurants. First reason, the smell of cigarette will fill the air and mixed with the smell of the food. People will not have the appetite to eat if their food smells like cigarette, or can't smell their meal because of the cigarette. Moreover, some smokers don't have any respect for the other customers, they blow the smoke right from their mouth to other's faces or throw the ash of the cigarette on the floor or plates. Second reason, many people would avoid the restaurants those are filled with smokers, especially if they bring children with them. It's uncomfortable to eat while thinking about their children's health, since children are easier to get the effect of the secondhand smoke. The first two reasons could affect the income of the restaurants slowly and cause great deal of loss. The last reason, there are many people in the restaurant who will be the secondhand smokers which is very dangerous because secondhand smokers could get lung cancer and many other infections much easier then the smokers themselves. The victims are not only the guests, but also the worker and the passersby. All in all, smoking in a restaurant should be a forbidden thing and the smokers should be put in an isolated room.
