When teenagers were high school students, they have less responsibility, less self-dependency, and they are still living in their comfort zone. Therefore, as soon as they step into college life, they have stepped into adulthood as well. As an adult, they have to be independent, able to take care of themselves, and take bigger responsibility for their own life. That is why college students should have a part time job. There are three reasons why they should have a part time job; to learn to not be dependent on one's parents, to be able to work, and to learn to have their responsibility as an adult. First of all, by taking a part time job, high school students who just turned into college students can be independent and learn to not lean on their parents anymore since they will part from them later on. Second, by taking a part time job, they can learn about working and earning money. Although part time job is a small job, but it can give them a picture of how working world is and how they make a living through it so that later when they are working in a company or starting their own business, they already know how to adapt and what to do. Lastly, through the part time job, they can learn on how to be responsible to themselves, by doing their work properly, and to others who are related to the part time job, the costumers, the managers, and co-workers. That is why college students should take a part time job.
