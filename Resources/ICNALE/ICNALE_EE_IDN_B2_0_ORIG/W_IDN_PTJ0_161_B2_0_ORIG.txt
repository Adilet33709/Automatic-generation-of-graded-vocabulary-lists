Part time job is very important for college students. The statement was made based on my own reason. First, have a part time job will be useful for us one day in the future. We could learn how to earn our own money, how to manage our income, and many other things so the time we have will not be wasted. Moreover, if we are from another island, our part time job could reduce our family's financial problem even if it's just a little. Second, we must admit, sometimes, the money that is transferred monthly by our parents is not enough for our daily need. Earning money by ourselves will be a very helpful thing so we won't burden our parents by asking more money. They also can't complain about how we are going to use it because it's the money that we earn, so we have the right to manage it by ourselves. Last but not least, part time job helps us to be independent. It gives us experience to handle the problems we will face in our full time job in the future. It also helps us to learn how to socialize with our co-workers, how to be close with them, or how to handle the problems those occurred by them. It's also easier to find a job if we have the experience to work for the other people. For example, if we ever had a job and want to find a new job, our chance to be accepted is higher than the ones who never have a job at all. So I conclude that having a part time job is very important for college students.
