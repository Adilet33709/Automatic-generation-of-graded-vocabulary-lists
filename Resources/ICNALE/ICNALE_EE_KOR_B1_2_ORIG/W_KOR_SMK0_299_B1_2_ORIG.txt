I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First, Smoking is not good at our health. Smoke that made of various toxic chemical ingredients is cause of every disease as well as not good at health. Also, Smoking is especially not good at lungs. So, It makes hard to breath during exercise of singing etc. Next, Non-smoking people in restaurant become target of second-hand smoking if we allow smoking in restaurant. I heard that second-hand smoking is more harmful than first hand smoking. Maybe, There is weak person such as children, pregnant women and the elderly in restaurant. And these weak people never want to have second-hand smoking because I think it is very harmful experience for them. These days, almost cafeterias are divided to two places that smoking place and non-smoking place. I think dividing to two places is one of the good way but, It is hard to perfect effect. So, I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country if we have smoking room outside of restaurants.
