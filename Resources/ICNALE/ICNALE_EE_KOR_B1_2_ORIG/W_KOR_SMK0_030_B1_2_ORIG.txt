I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Ultimately, restaurants are the place to offer food. They need to supply fresh food and clean hall to customer. Of course, people who visit a restaurant want to have dishes in pleasant surroundings. Imagine, when you are eating a delicious meal at a restaurant, smokers are smoking at the next table. Smoke is getting to spread in the air. You should be upset and lose your appetite. It is absolutely bad behavior to smoke in most of places where many people visit. Person who smokes in these areas lacks consideration for others and has no manner. They must know their fault and correct the deformed posture. A mature sense of citizenship helps to grow a high country level. However, it is better to prepare smoking sections for smokers in a lot of restaurant because smokers have a right to respect their liberty and personality. If smoking is prohibited in the restaurants by the law, lots of smokers cannot accept obediently. Anyway, I am sure that it is a serious social problem. We have to find out the best policy to satisfy both non-smokers and smokers.
