I completely agree this statement. In the restaurant visit the variety an age group. For example. Kids, Juveniles, adult who stop smoking, old person who don't like smoke smell etc. If kids and juveniles were sent the smoke smell or see smoking, Smoking is very harmful for them. Some curiosity the kids, juveniles think "I want to smoke". & if adults who stop smoking were scent the smell, they want smoke, finally they again smoke and they lose health. Expense of tobacco is expensive. So if they (smoking) were stops smoking, they save money and they spend meaningfully. For example they donation for African who they don't money and don't have food water and medicine that they save their life from disease. Or spend for family and buy the house. Also tobacco is very addictive. They so called "be sold drug ". Above all smoking is very harmful and secondhand smoking is very hazard for health. So I insist ban smoking in restaurant. If Smoking ban was not ban at law, the nation is appointment that smoking area. And if they were disobeying the law, the government is punishing ruthlessly or considerably penalty that jail and community service that period is very long.
