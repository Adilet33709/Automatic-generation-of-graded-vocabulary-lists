I agree. I have many friends who are having a part-time job. They often work around a university. In particular, they go to there after finishing the lesson. I do not have experience which works a part-time job. Nevertheless, I believe that college students need to work specially during school vacation. Because, First, A part-time job offers students importance of money. They will get money through hard suffer. Therefore, they will use little money and save money. College students usually spend drinking and enjoying friends so, they use money easily. It can intend to save money from the wastefulness. Second, students are receiving a lot of money from their parent. Especially, registration fee is very expensive but many students obtain their parent. If they get money to use their personal expense, parents will think a hard feel. Accordingly, students need to make the money to use on their own. Last, students get a priceless experience through a part-time job. After graduate from college, they will work at company and occur many things at their company. If they have a part-time job, they obtain a new opportunity before a true job. They can learn about their key contents and factors in advance. It is main thing for college students to have a part-time job.
