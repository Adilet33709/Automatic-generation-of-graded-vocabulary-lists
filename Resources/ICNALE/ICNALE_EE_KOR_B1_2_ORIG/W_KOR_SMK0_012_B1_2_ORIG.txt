I agree that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have two reasons. First of all, more likely to develop cancer. To human cancer, we are experiencing now 30-40 percent of the cancers caused by tobacco. At least 20 kinds of cigarettes inside the Level A may contain carcinogens. The accumulation of carcinogens in tobacco smoke continuously for long periods depend on the type of cancer greatly increases the probability of occurrence of cancer. Currently we are experiencing mankind 30-40% of cancer is caused by a cigarette. Therefore, if the world did not smoke 30-40% of all cancers would not have occurred. And Second reason is another disease. Leads to respiratory diseases. Cigarette smoking and respiratory function continued to weaken. Continue to smoke cigarettes to stimulate primary airway inflammation and cough up phlegm and bronchial wall thickening, creates a narrowing of bronchial as weakens the respiratory function. Culinary function in bronchial mucosa also weakens the ability extremely satisfying to hear less mucus. So who smoked cigarettes for a long time that deep mucus remained above lung strange sounds. As these reasons, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
