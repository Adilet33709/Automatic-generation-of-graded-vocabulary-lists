These days, many college students tend to stay at home without having part-time job because of self-improvement. Of course, this behavior gives them a lot of time that spend self-improvement. However, I agree that college students have part-time job. There are some reasons why I agree it. First, college students keep spirit of independence. For example, they endure hard duties for a month to earn the money. These processes encourage themselves and foster their independence. In addition to, the survey of student council shows that students who experience part-time job have independence about four times compared with ones who didn't experience part-time job. Second, college students are able to pay the school expenses. According to civic organization's survey, seventy percent of college students pay their registration fee in installments with the money to earn for themselves during vacation. Third, to have a part-time job can make college students very organized and offer useful information. It is reported that employees who experience part-time quickly job adjust to new environment compared with employees who didn't experience part-time job. In addition to, college students who have part-time job can obtain the information that help them find the job. For these reason, I highly agree that college students have part-time job; spirit of independence, school expense, adaptability.
