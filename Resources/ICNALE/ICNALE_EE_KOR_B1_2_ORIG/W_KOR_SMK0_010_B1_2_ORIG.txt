In many countries, smoking is banned in supermarkets, restaurants, hospitals, airplanes, and most from of public transportation. I'm all against of this. In Univ, there are so many smokers than not smoking people. In other words, I disagree with idea of prohibiting smoking in public. So, in my opinion, we don't have to quit smoking. Cigarette is the smoker's favorite food, just like how someone enjoys the favorite tea or coffee. Just consider for not smoking people. For example, smokers should smoke in the limited area. This is a common sense. We don't have to quit smoking. But you can get a bad effect to it. First of all it is dangerous to health. And, cancer or any disease will be occurred. Second, it can be smokeholic. And third, it causes ugly smell from the body. So, many people will keep far from one. And fourth, there will be much money spent, and it is terrible big amount if it was accumulated. Thus, it is unfair to prohibit smoking in public. If smoking in public is prohibited, the smokers' rights to smoke are ignored. Making a smoking area in public is the best way to respect both smokers and non-smokers. Then, you'd better release to smoke than to quit. Thus, I don't agree to quit smoking.
