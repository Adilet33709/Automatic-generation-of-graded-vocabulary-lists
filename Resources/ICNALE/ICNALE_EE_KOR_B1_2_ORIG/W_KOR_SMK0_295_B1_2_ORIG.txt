Everyone wants to have a good healthy life, without getting any diseases. One way to stop from having such a miserable life is to know what is good and bad for your body, and not do what is injurious for you. Many people smoke knowing that it can damage your body pretty easily. However, those same people want to have a life with no pain. Those people do not deserve a right to think about being an existence without agony. I think that is really absurd. God gave us a mind to think for ourselves, and do what is right for us. And expecting to have a great life smoking your lungs out, is really ridiculous and silly. The most substance that is used for a cigarette is tobacco. First it is burned then is inhaled in a person's body. When it settles down and finds a place for it in the lungs, it forms a black hole which leads to lung cancer. Therefore, I really recommend people to stop smoking. You might ask, Then why do people sell cigarettes? Simple. Money. That is the answer. Instead of thinking about other people's health, they need the money. However, from the very beginning of your life, safety and health was the most important thing, and is. Let's say some people don't really care about their own health, so they think its ok. However, smoking also harms the people around you. When you inhale the smoke, you don't keep it in there. You exhale it back out. Therefore, that smoke can affect other people's lungs too. Smoking is the most popular drug use. It is also considered to be addictive. We all don't want to lose our lives like this. It is the best gift you can get. So let's stop doing what is harmful for our body and start caring for it more.
