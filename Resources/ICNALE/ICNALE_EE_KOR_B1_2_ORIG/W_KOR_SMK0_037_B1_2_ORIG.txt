I agree Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I think almost people agree too. Restaurants are public place, not alone place. I don't think smoking is bad, smoking in restaurants is a bad. Non-smoker is damaged by smoker because of secondhand-smoking. I see a secondhand-smoking is hurter than smoking in news. Smoking in restaurants, is an expose other people to disease. The target cans your family. Image one case, today is a family eat out. Your sun seat next to you. You start smoking, your sun breathe smoke. Your sun is non-smoker. Your sun what think about you? Maybe he feels shame. Because he has a conscience. He thinks your smoking is restaurants are a wrong doing. Don't you agree? Everyone knows smoking in restaurants is a not good, child, adult, teenager, oldster. You must think mostly people health. Don't smoking in restaurants only for your pleasure. You want smoking in eat out, you go out and smoking that time, that a manner. Now days almost restaurants have a smoking-room. Your few steps will be other persons happy. For almost persons happy, smoking in restaurants should be banded and smoker must observe this law. That's a win-win strategy both position.
