I totally agree with the idea of Topic A (It is important for college students to have a part-time job. ) Let's see some reasons. First of all, it is a good and suitable way for college students who need to pay their tuition themselves. For example, one of my college friends has a part-time job for her tuition. After finishing school, she goes to her part time job place right away. Secondly, we can have lots of experience about many jobs before we have our own job. For example, when we are college students, some students don't know what kind of jobs they want to have after graduating college, so having a part-time job is a good standard for some students to think about what they want to be after graduating college. Thirdly, having a part time-job is important for college students to have socialization. Of course, they can have socialization when they are in a college, but this is not enough for them. As far as I know it's very important to meet many kinds of people as long as one has breath, so they can meet many kinds of people when they have part-time jobs. That's why it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
