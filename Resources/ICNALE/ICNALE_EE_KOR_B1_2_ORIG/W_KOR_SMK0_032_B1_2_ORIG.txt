A lot of people smoke a cigarette everywhere to mitigate the stress. Of course, it seems to relieve their mind to smoke cigarette. However, I disagree that smoker draw at public place as well as the entire restaurant. I think that smoking should be completely banned at public place in country. There are some reasons supporting my idea. First, passive smokers are more likely to get cancer compared with non-smokers and smokers. According to WHO report, passive smokers are always exposed to fatal disease like cancer and they are in with a shout of getting cancer three times to four times compared with non-smokers and smokers. Second, to smoke a cigarette cost a lot of social expense. The survey of the Ministry of Health and Welfare shows that smoking area is the most expensive money to clean the surroundings because of time and employee. Third, smoking can cause dangerous accident like fire. According to the National Emergency Management Agency, it says that fire in restaurant is caused by the light of a cigarette thrown away carelessly. As a result, many people are injured by this situation. For these reasons, I absolutely assert that smoking should be banned all places except smoking area in country.
