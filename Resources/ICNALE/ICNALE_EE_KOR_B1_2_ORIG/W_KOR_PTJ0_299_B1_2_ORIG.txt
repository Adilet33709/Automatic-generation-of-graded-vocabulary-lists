I think that part time job is very important during university life. First, Work, it is very precious experience. Part time jobs in university life are almost part of service. So, through work that part of service, we can meet people of various fields and can talk with a strange person. First time I have part time job, I can't talk with other strange person because I have no confidence and shy. But, now I can talk perfectly strange person. I think these experience is privilege of part timer. Next, We can know important of money. Until high school student, I always live with pocket money given by my parents and I didn't know it is hard to make money. After becoming 20, I work hard to earn money about 5000-6000won per hour and now, I think carefully when I spend money just drinking a cup of coffe and just eating a spoon of ice cream. During five month that I work to earn money, I have had very various part time jobs but I want to have more various jobs and meet more people of various fields. because I think it is very valuable experience that can do during part time jobs and its experience is so powerful. Therefore I think it is very important for college students to have a part time job.
