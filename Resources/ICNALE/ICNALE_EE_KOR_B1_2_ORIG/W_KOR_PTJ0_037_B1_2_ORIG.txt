I agree important for college students to have a part-time job. I have many bases in my opinion. Almost college students don't go to school their house. They live near the college. It needs lots of money. Naturally, this life imposes a heavy burden on their parents. We offered many time by college. At left time if we have a part time job, less the burden your parents, and a part time job offer many experience. You can work in many kinds of occupation through part time job. You will meet many different people in a various working place. I think that's a most important thing. And a part-time is possible to understand economic activities. Manage spend and income yourself. At first it is a hard, but in the running of time you will feel that's easy. It's a practice your future social life. I think a part time job have a many mercy. You don't spend left time another thing, have a part time job. I recommend go out to library and working do not study everyday every time. It's a greater help than library life to you. It gives many things to you. It's a hard to work, but it doesn't disappointment you. I'm confident it.
