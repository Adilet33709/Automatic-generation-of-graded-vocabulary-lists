I'm all for part time job. Todays, Most of the students are having a part time job because they can't live with pocket money of their parent. And we don't have enough money to go to university. Entry money is so expensive, too. So we cannot but having a part time job. I have a part time job, too. If the entry pay will be low, We don't have to get a part time job. But, now. The entry money is expensive. so poor students should have a part time job. And It will help to raise an independence. While we are having it, we can earn some money for myself. For an example, it will be good to have such experience of working at a store, when they want to open such stores. However there is demerit of having jobs that is accumulation of stress. Because we cannot earn much money in a short time. Finally, if you have a dream what you want to do, you can choose the right part time job. So you can experience it before you come true your dream. So I agree to have a part time job in the univ. Accordingly, I made my position to agree with this idea.
