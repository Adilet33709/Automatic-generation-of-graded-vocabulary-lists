I agree that it is important for college students have a part-time job even though I have never worked at a part-time job. Nowadays, most of college students have to spend a huge amount of registration fee to study in university. The price of registration fee is approached almost \400-500. However, they don't have any ability to pay this. So, their parents have to shoulder the entire costs instead of them. If students work at part-time jobs, they would lighten their burden. I think it is also one of the ways to help parents. The other reason why I agree on it is that it can help to gain a lot of experience for students' careers. For employment, many companies demand lots of careers to students. It would be one of good experiences to have part-time jobs. Also, students who work part-time job can learn how to treat people and to do social life, like that. In addition, they can develop their personality like diligence, manners, sense, and partnership. That's why it is important for college students have a part-time job. Some people worry about that it disturbs student's study. But, students belong to part-time job have to control their time and strength themselves.
