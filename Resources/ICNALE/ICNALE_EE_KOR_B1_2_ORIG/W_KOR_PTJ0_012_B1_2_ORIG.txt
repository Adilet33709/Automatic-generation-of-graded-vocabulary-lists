I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have three reasons why it is important. First of all, In order to maintain their livelihood. There is many students who under difficult. We can't live if you do not eat something. If there is no energy, no life can live. Second reason is conversation skill. It is very important because we need social skill in social. We should talk to other people what you need. It will learn from real life rather than learning. I believe that this help to prove this skill in Part-time job. When it is important you do not tell, cannot get what you need. You can continue to say that the opportunity is at part time job. And last reason is Univ. Major. I hope that if you want to have a part time job, consider what your major is and what kind of part time job will help us. For example my case, my major is English literature. To study English and to level up my, I will find kind of part time job which is related English. As these reason, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
