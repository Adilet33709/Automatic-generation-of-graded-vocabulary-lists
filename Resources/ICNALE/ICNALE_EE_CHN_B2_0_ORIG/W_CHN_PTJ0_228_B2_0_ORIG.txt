Nowadays, there's a growing trend for college students to have a part-time job, such as tutors, waitress, teacher assistants, etc. Some people think it is good for students to have some practical experiences through a part-time job, while others argue it's purely waste of time. However, the question whether it is important for college students to have a part-time job is quite controversial, at least to me. There are certain advantages for a part-time job. As is so often been emphasized, practical experience should be applied to theoretical knowledge we've learned on the class. Having a part-time is an ideal method to increase one's practical skills and expand social network during the college. Besides, a part-time job can be a stimulus for students to study harder. Through working, one may find what he lacks when comparing to a experienced employee. Thus, in order to have a better career after graduation, he may have a solitude goal to his study and achieve greater progress. Moreover, students who have a part-time job may become independent earlier than those who don't, for they may obtain a clear view of money through earning it by their own. But the disadvantages should not be neglected. Having a part-time job may occupy too much time, which leaves little for one to do his study. Instead of acting as a stimulus, in this case the part-time job becomes a obstacle. Such cases should be taken into consideration since it happens all the time when there's a big project in the work for you to conduct. The lack of the ability of time management can make the situation even worse. In conclusion, whether a part-time job is important to a student depend on the attribution of the job as well as the ability of the student. There's no easy way to answer the question
