Should smoking be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country? Yes, it should. Some smokers may feel that their freedom of smoking is limited, but smoking in public places especially in restaurants may give rise to some problems. It is widely accepted that smoking does harm to our health. Smoking can increase the possibility of catching some cancers. According to some international surveys, the number of people who died of cancers related to smoking is increasing rapidly over the years. What's more, smoking influences not only the health of smokers, but also the second-hand smokers'. The ban on smoking at all the restaurants can certainly reduce the effect of second-hand smoking. In this way, it is a quite reasonable rule that all the customers should obey. To ban smoking in restaurants can also help educate the teenagers. As we all know, the number of teenagers who smoke is rising rapidly. Instead of telling the children that it is not a good habit to smoke, the non-smoking signs in the restaurants can lead the children to recognize the dangers more easily. Of course, it is of great significance for a successful restaurant to keep a clean and comfortable atmosphere. The customers may feel uncomfortable and uneasy when exposed to the smoke in the restaurants. How can a restaurant provide a satisfactory service to its customers when the customers feel a sense of not being at home? After all, restaurants are public places to eat and enjoy ourselves, the smoke can easily affect the quality of a restaurants' service. Given these reasons, we can now draw a conclusion that the ban on smoking at all the restaurants is reasonable and necessary.
