Nowadays, more and more students tend to have a part-time job in their leisure time so that they can earn some pocket money by themselves. Different people have various opinions on this issue. Some people think that it is a golden chance for college students to practise themselves, while others believe that it is a waste of time to do a part-time job. As for me, I feel that a part-time job does more good than harm. Generally speaking, it's important for college students to have a part-job. To begin with, a part-time job will bring more social experience. Those who have a part-time job are more likely to get in touch with various people in society. They can learn how to get along with different people and solve a problem in a short time. It's not hard for us to find that the students with a part-time job are more active and efficient in both study and work. In addition, a part-time job will show them the significance of cooperation. On condition that they would liketo do a job, they must talk to their workmates and cooperate with them. And their habit of cooperation will play an important role in teamwork on campus. However, on the other hand, if one spends so much time on a part-time job that it affects his study. Then he should decrease the time on it or give it up, for our main duty is to study well, not to earn money at present. In one word, a part-time job is really beneficial to us, let's take an active part in it!
