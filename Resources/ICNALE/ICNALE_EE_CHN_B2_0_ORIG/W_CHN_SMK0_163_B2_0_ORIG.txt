With more importance being attach to health, people begin to search for different ways to stay healthy. Of course the stress from people's daily life is more and more. So, the number of people who smoke is increasing. But, there is a problem wheather Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. In my view, it is needed. First, smoking causes many deaths of lung cancers. Second hand smoke affects pregnant women, children and elderly people more. Smoking is also bad examples fro teens and young adults shows that is okay to smoke. Smoking should be banned in restaurant. Then, regardless if there is a Non smoking section and a smoking section, this does nothing. The smoke still spreads throughout the restaurant. Some people are sensitive to cigarette smoke. Also smoking just doesn't cause damage to others peoples health but it is smelly. People who are non smokers do not want to smell like smoke. So, this action must be acted. A non-smoking person should be able to sit down in a restaurant and not inhale unhealthful smoke while they eat. If they want to smoke they can go outside or if the restaurant is smart enough they would create a whole new room separate from NON smokers. As far as I am concerned, it is necessary that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
