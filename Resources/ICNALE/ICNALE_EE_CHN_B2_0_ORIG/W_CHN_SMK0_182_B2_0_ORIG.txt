Should smoking be banned at all the restaurants? About this, different people hold different views. Some people agree and some people don't agree with it. In my opinion, I agree with it, that is, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants. There have been a large number of smokers. Many people have the habit of smoking. What's more, some of them are addicted to it. They can't live without it. So they will also smoke at public places such as restaurants. But nonsmokers hate it, they hate to smell it. They even complain that they inhale the second-hand smoke in restaurants that would greatly harm to their health. Therefore, it is really harmful to people in the restaurant. It will also affect people's appetite. I hate them who smoke at the restaurant. Firstly it does harm to everyone. Secondly, I think it is an irresponsible behavior. Last but not least, it can pollute the clean air. Nowadays, more and more people come to know that smoking is bad for people's health. It can lead to lung cancer, and heart problem. Smokers also decide to give up smoking. Some of them also think that the law to ban people smoking can encourage them to give up smoking. Above all, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants.
