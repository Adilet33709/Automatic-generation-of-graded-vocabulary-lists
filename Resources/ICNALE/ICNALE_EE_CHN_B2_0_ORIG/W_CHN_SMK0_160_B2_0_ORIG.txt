Whether smoking should be banned at all restaurants has become a controversial issue, arousing great public concern. Personally, I think it is an important behavior to ban smoke at restaurant and we should not allow this condition in the restaurant any more. First and foremost, there's no denying that smoking does harm to the smokers and in the meantime to others. Although those people have been addicted to smoking, they are supposed to pay more attention to the others' health in public. Moreover, it is common believed that smoking destroy the elegant atmosphere at the restaurant. Non- smokers don't want to get harmed by the cigarette smoke in the restaurants. They come to the restaurants for a happy meal. Therefore, I suggest that the government should create a place especially for the smokers and the problem will be solved gradually. Last but not least, educated as most Chinese people are, it is crucial for us to behave formally and gently in public. In summary, taking many factors into consideration, I hope that this phenomenon will disappear after so many people's combat. Besides, our government had better take actions to protect the environment at restaurant and solve the problem as soon as possible.
