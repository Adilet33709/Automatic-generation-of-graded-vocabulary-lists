 The manners in public are a good way to show the quality of people in a country; hence, smoking, which is of bad influence for the environment and health, should be completely banned at all restaurants to keep good manners. Smoking does a great damage in the health of the smokers and people around him; for example, the second-hand smoke will greatly influence the consumers during having dinner. And also, a place which is full of smoke would damage the dinner atmosphere, and have a bad effect on the consumers' feeling. So from the both sides of the consumers and restaurant, the smoking should be completely banned. Besides, as we all know, the behaviors in public decide the quality of people in the country. If smoking isn't banned at the restaurant, the image and quality of Chinese will be misunderstood. Our country is becoming stronger and more powerful these years, and also the quality of people should be improved by the efforts by all of us. However, the government and restaurants should also learn some experience from 2010 Shanghai EXPO. We can build some place for smoking, or just set a room for the smokers, which is also a concern for them. So smoking should be banned, and we should also spare some room for the smokers.
