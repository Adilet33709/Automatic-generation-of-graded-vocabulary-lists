Today an increasing number of college students take part-time jobs. Have you ever taken a part-time job?There are many advantages for us to take part-time jobs. Firstly, part-time jobs help us keep up with the outside world. They can gain working experience and become more independent. Besides, it's a good chance for us to put what we have learned at college into practice. Through part-time jobs, we can prepare ourselves for our future jobs. What's more, we can make money to pay for everything we want. On the other hand, it can release our family financial burden. However, there also are many disadvantages. If we take part-time jobs, it is likely for us to distract from our studying. We may spend too much time and energy. For example, we may lose time needed for sleep, rest, study, club activities and recreation. So that it is harmful to our health. In my opinion, as a college student we should take the right attitude to part-time jobs. Although, part-time jobs can open us a window to know about the society, we must keep a balance between the job and the study! However, I think I should pay more attention to school study.
