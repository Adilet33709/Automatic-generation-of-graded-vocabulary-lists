Nowadays, there are many college students who take part in the part-time jobs. Some people think that it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. To me, it is not a good idea. To have a part-time job is not as important as to make a great achievement in study. Having a part-time job means that you don't have enough time to study. As a result of this, the quality of education will decline and many students cannot process enough professional knowledge suitable for future work. Meanwhile, many students can earn extra money from their part-time job. Therefore, they have gotten into a habit that spends their money unreasonably. Since they have worked hard for their money, they think they deserve a luxury life instead of studying after working for a whole day. How can a tired student study hard in his or her lessons?In a word, the disadvantages of having a part-time job for a college student outweigh the advantages of it. We can't only focus on the working experience of a student. Instead, the knowledge in the professional field is more important when we are still students. So we should try to pay more attention to our study now rather than do some part-time jobs.
