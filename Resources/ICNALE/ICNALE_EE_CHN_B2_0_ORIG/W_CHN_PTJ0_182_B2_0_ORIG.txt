Nowadays, more and more college student took part-time jobs in their spare time as salesmen, waiters or shop assistants. They are engaged in part-time jobs because they want to earn some tuition to help their family in the meantime to have work experiences. People wonder whether it is good for students to do so. Some people are afraid that taking a part-time job will spend their too much time. It will influence their study. Some people disagree with them, they think it will be a good way to make young students know that how hard to earn the money and get the experience from it. To have a part-time job becomes a hot topic, today. In my view, I agree with the latter, firstly, students can earn some money from the part-time jobs to help their family. Second, we can learn a lot from it, and get the chance to show how much we have learned from the school. Last but not least, a part-time job can train our ability of working, cooperation and getting along with others. In the word, get a part-time job is not only good for earn money but also in study and ability! So if you have chance, try to get a part-time job.
