Whether college students should take part-time jobs has aroused great public concern. As far as I'm concerned, part-time job plays an increasing important role in college life and I'm for the idea. Nevertheless, several people argue that it is a waste of time to take a part-time job and obviously, college students ought to put more emphasis on their study. In addition, part-time job not only takes up much of their free time but also means little to them. On the contrary, others think that it is acceptable, reasonable, and beneficial to take a part-time job. The reasons are as follows. First of all, it is undeniable that college students can accumulate certain experience through part-time jobs. Then, as a result of doing part-time jobs, we can earn some pocket money in order to reduce parents' burden. What's more, admittedly, if you do some more work at your free time, you will find life is not so dull and you can do something meaningful to enjoy your college life. In a word, from my perspective, part-time job, to some extent, is indispensable to our college life. Regardless of other people's ideas, I support my own opinion and I think it is essential for college students to take part-time job.
