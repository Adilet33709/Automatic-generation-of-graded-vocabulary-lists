It is universally considered that smoking does much damage to human health and passive smoking causes even more serious effects to the people around. According to statistics showed by newspaper, about five percent death is related to passive smoking. Due to the terrible effects of public smoking, I hold the opinion that smoking should be banned in any public restaurants across the country. By doing so, one of the most important favorable effects is that diseases related to smoking can be cut down significantly such as lung cancer. The ban contributes a lot in creating a healthy dining environment for people who frequently eat outside, which takes a large proportion of the whole population. Secondly, prohibiting smoking in some public areas contributes greatly to the development of social culture and ideology. Like drunken driving, which poses threaten to citizens' safety, smoking in public does harm to others' health. Such behavior is against our goal of establishing a harmony society. In addition, the forceful act of complete banning raises the awareness of the harm of smoking among the general public. More and more smokers will gradually get rid of this bad habit for the interest of their own health. To conclude, it is high time for us to take strong measures to put an end to this smoking era and a complete legal system on the smoking issue is necessary for the final settlement of the social problem.
