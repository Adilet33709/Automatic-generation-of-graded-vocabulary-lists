Personally, I believe a part-time job is necessary and enormously helpful for college students, especially for junior or senior students. At least, by undertaking a part-time job, we can gain three major advantages. First and foremost, through certain kind of part-time jobs, our knowledge fields are extended and horizons are broadened. For instance, a student major in engineering works as a marketing intern during his vacation to gain more knowledge on business management. Such practice is of much significance to the overall development of a future talent. Secondly, the experience of internship helps students a lot in dealing with various cases and communicating with people from all areas. Staying at school, we students contacts frequently with our fellow students and professors, but they are only a small part of the whole society. By going out of the school and locating ourselves at a complex enterprise, we are urged to meet and approach with our supervisor and boss, who are usually successful and complicated in their own field. They can be good mentors of our future career development. In addition, by working part-timely, students can earn some money, which alleviates the financial burden of their family. For college students, they are mature enough to be financial independent. To sum up, taking a part-time job benefits students on many levels and it must be a good choice for us when arranging for our holiday schedule.
