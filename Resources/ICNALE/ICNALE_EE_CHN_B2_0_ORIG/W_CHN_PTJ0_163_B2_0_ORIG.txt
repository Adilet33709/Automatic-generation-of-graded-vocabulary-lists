The previous arguments always focus on the necessity of college students having a part-time job. With people's more and more awareness of the benefits of having a part-time job, they all support their children to have one in their universities. In today's society, however, a part-time job is becoming necessary in a college school student's life. Money is needed now more than ever. A number of teenagers are entering the workforce. The modern times in which we live accommodate the need for teenagers to have their own source of income. A part-time job not only enables students to promote their abilities, but also help them apply their knowledge to practice. Furthermore, students who have part-time jobs can relieve that the economic burdens of their parents. Your studies should remain your main focus, but if you have the chance to earn some money and gain experience while you're in school. In my opinion, students can choose to take up a part-time job according to their own situation. The most important thing for them is to keep a good balance between part-time jobs and his study. Taking advantage of a part-time job in the college does practice yourself. So I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job if they do it properly.
