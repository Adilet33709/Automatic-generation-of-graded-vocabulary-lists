I agree with the point. Nowadays, there is a hot discussion about whether smoking should be banned all the restaurants. People who smoke argue that it takes away their freedom. However nonsmokers advocate it is a good rule. From my perspective, I think smoking should be banned in all restaurants. Firstly, smoking which will bring many diseases does harm to our health. Besides, smoking gives much gas off into air, which pollutes our environment. What' more, many people cannot put up with the smoking gas, which makes them sick. It is not surprising that smoking banned in all restaurants will promote workers efficiency. Therefore, it is very important and necessary to us to ban smoking in all restaurants. If one wants to smoke, he can smoking in private. My suggestion is that they should give up smoking. It is beneficial to both our health and environment. Smoking should be banned in all restaurants. Only in this way can we breathe more flesh air in the future!Today more and more people all over the world want to give up smoking. If you're not a smoker, don't start. In fact, smoking is a bad habit, which has great harm to people's health.
