Just as an old saying goes, one coin has two sides, part-time job can bring us some convenient, money, expand our social experience, but can also waste our time, scatter our concentration, and may eventually influence our grades in the university. For me, I think the bad influence of part-time job overweighs more than the advantages, and it's not necessary for college students to have a part-time job. Part-time job wastes our academic and free time. University is a place to study the latest knowledge, try to get involved in many fields, such as some other course besides our own major. However, part-time job would take up most of the time; and if we cannot use the time in our university more efficiently, we would lose the time to improve ourselves both physically and emotionally. There are some other ways to make money and fulfill our social experience, except for part-time job. For the students in great need of money to get through the university, part-time job isn't the only method. We can ask for some fund and scholars from our school, also we can be a TA. So we can use some academic ways to make money. Besides, internship is a better way to get social experience. Also, part-time job would scatter our focus on the campus life. For example, if we get a part-time job as a tutor for high school students, we must have to prepare the classes, get to the classroom or the students' house. And all the things will bother us and break the peaceful campus life. To sum up, part-time job isn't important and necessary for college students. What we have done in our university will decide the way of our whole life, and obviously we should make better use of the period.
